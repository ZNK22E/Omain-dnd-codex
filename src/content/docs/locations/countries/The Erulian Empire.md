### **1. Origins and Foundation**

The empire was founded by **Emperor Calados I** in **Year 0 of the Erulian Calendar**, an event marking the formal establishment of the empire, the creation of the **Hexadem religion**, and the introduction of the first recorded timekeeping system in Omain. The Erulian Calendar divides history into:

- **A.H. — After Hexadem** (from Year 0 onward)
- **B.H. — Before Hexadem** (dates prior to the empire’s founding)

Originally composed solely of the Erulian human tribe, the empire gradually expanded through conquest, colonization, religious influence, and integration, eventually evolving into a **multicultural imperial state** incorporating races, cultures, and regions beyond its homeland.

---

### **2. Historical Significance**

Throughout its history, the Erulian Empire has exerted control over vast regions of Omain, including large parts of both major continents. Its influence shaped global religion, language, trade, war, and governance. The empire is widely regarded as the primary architect of recorded world history and the standard-setter for calendars, diplomacy, and organized religion.

Although its land holdings have diminished significantly from their height, many nations trace cultural or historical roots back to Erulian rule.

---

### **3. Current Government and State**

The modern Erulian Empire is an **authoritarian state** ruled by **Empress Erolith I**, who holds total legal, political, military, and religious authority. Centralized power structures, strict imperial law, and institutional dominance reinforce the empire’s continued relevance, despite reduced territorial size.

- **Current size:** **19.0 million km²**
- **Status:** Smallest territorial extent in imperial history
- **Global role:** Still the dominant cultural and geopolitical power

The empire remains heavily centralized around Erule, its capital and spiritual birthplace.

### **5. Geological Features**

Several major natural landmarks are located within or along the borders of the empire:

#### **Dead Man’s Lake**

Located on the border between Erule and the Kingdom of Ka. Named due to its long history as a battlefield and strategic conflict zone.

#### **Erulian Desert**

A vast desert east of the imperial heartland, extending into the foothills of the Western Draconic Mountains. Notable for its rare seasonal snowfall caused by elevation and wind patterns from the mountains.

#### **Erulian Plains**

An extensive grassland region covering much of the empire’s agricultural core. These plains served as the homeland of early Erulian tribes and later became the foundation of imperial expansion.
