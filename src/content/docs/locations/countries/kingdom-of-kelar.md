## **Overview**

**Kelar** is the youngest nation in Omain, founded in **1223 A.H.** after the draconic clans of the Kelarian Mountains repelled an Erulian siege on the stronghold of **Draceis Montis**. The defeat marked the first recorded failure of an Erulian invasion against draconic territory and directly led to the establishment of Kelar as a sovereign state.

The region is steeped in **draconic ancestry**, with many inhabitants descending from ancient dragons and dragonborn bloodlines. Unlike most nations shaped by human dynasties, Kelar’s society centers on **draconic heritage, lineage, and ancient oaths**, rather than cultural assimilation or conquest. Vast portions of the **Kelarian and Western Draconic Mountains** are considered sacred ancestral lands, believed to hold primordial lairs, burial sites, and spiritual nexuses tied to the origins of dragon-kind.

## **Origins and Foundations**
**Kelar** is the youngest sovereign nation in Omain, founded in **1223 A.H.** in the aftermath of the failed Erulian siege of **Draceis Montis**, a fortified draconic settlement located deep within the Kelarian Mountains. Prior to its formation, the region was contested highland territory largely ungoverned by external powers, though nominally claimed by the Erulian Empire.

The attempted siege marked a turning point in the relationship between draconic clans and the Empire. The assault was repelled decisively by dragon forces, prompting the dragons to formally declare the mountain range and surrounding territories **a sovereign state established for their own protection and autonomy**.

Following the declaration, the dragons expanded their claim beyond the core mountain region to include **the Western Draconic Mountains**, a major range situated between **Thaxted** and **Hatland**. These territories were consolidated under the new nation and recognized as **the ancestral domain of draconic lineage**.

To solidify governance and establish diplomatic legitimacy, the draconic clans appointed a **dragonborn ruler** to lead the nation, creating a monarchy rooted in draconic heritage rather than human noble lineage. Modern Kelar remains culturally dominated by descendants of dragons and dragon-kind hybrids, with governance, symbolism, and society heavily shaped by ancient draconic traditions.

Today, Kelar is defined by:

- **Draconic ancestry and bloodlines**
    
- **Mountain-based settlements and high-altitude fortresses**
    
- **A political foundation built from resistance to the Erulian Empire**
    
- **Territorial claims spanning multiple mountain ranges**
    

Despite its youth as a political entity, Kelar commands significant strategic power due to its geography, its draconic population, and its origin as a nation formed in direct defiance of imperial expansion.

## **Geography/Borders**

Kelar spans a vast mountainous region across both major continents, with territory defined primarily by ancestral draconic land claims rather than conventional political boundaries. Its geography is dominated by high-altitude terrain, volcanic ridges, glacial lakes, and steep natural fortifications that make foreign invasion or occupation extremely difficult.

Although officially recognized as a single sovereign nation, Kelar's landholdings are **non-contiguous**, reflecting the fragmented nature of ancient draconic domains across both **Droskarin** and **Virelya**.

### **1. Borders**

Kelar’s territorial claims extend across two continents:

#### **📍 Droskarin Borders**

- **North:** Kingdom of Ka & Erulian Empire
    
- **West:** Chilborkia
    
- **South:** Helskirk
    
- **Northwest:** Small coastal territory on the **Shersian Channel**
    
- **South:** A narrow stretch of coastline on the **Grand Southern Ocean**
    

These regions form the heart of Kelar’s draconic settlements and contain the capital site, Draceis Montis.

---

#### **📍 Virelya Borders**

Through ancestral territorial rights over the Western Draconic Mountains, Kelar also borders:

- **West:** Thaxted
    
- **East:** Hatland
    

These western mountain claims are internationally disputed but largely uncontested militarily due to the region’s inhospitable terrain and draconic patrols.

### **2. Major Geographical Features**

|Landmark|Description|
|---|---|
|**Kelarian Mountains**|The dominant terrain of Kelar; vast twin mountain systems spanning both continents. Home to ancient draconic lairs, fortresses, and high-altitude settlements.|
|**Western Draconic Mountains**|A sub-range located between Thaxted and Hatland in Virelya; considered ancestral draconic territory and a sacred region.|
|**Draceis Montis**|Mountain stronghold and spiritual capital of the dragon clans; birthplace of Kelar as a nation.|
|**Frozen Lakes of the Kelarian Range**|High-elevation glacial lake clusters known for permanent ice layers, magical properties, and draconic pilgrimage routes.|
|**Tetford’s Peak**|_Height: 6,924 meters_ — the tallest mountain on Omain, located within Kelar territory in the western range. A sacred geological monument tied to ancient draconic creation myths.|
|**Metal Valleys (Bordering Chilborkia)**|Kelar controls a small eastern sector of the mineral-rich valleys extending from Chilborkia, used for forging draconic alloys and ritual armaments.|

### **3. Geographic Identity**

Kelar’s geography shapes nearly all aspects of its society:

- **Mountain strongholds instead of cities**
    
- **Fortress-paths and flight corridors rather than roads**
    
- **Population concentrated in high-altitude settlements**
    
- **Natural barriers acting as border walls**
    
- **Territory defined by ancestral claims rather than straight borders**
    

The nation’s geography reinforces its origins as a defensive refuge for ancient dragons rather than a conventional expansionist state.
