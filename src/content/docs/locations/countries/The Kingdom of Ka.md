The **Kingdom of Ka** is a sovereign nation on the eastern continent of Droskarin, known historically as the former region of **Bolborkia**, homeland of the human Bolborkian tribes. Once conquered and absorbed by the Erulian Empire in **74 A.H.** under Emperor Talios I, the region later broke away and reestablished independence in **516 A.H.** following a successful uprising led by **Joriel I**. The nation was renamed the _Kingdom of Ka_ by its most recent monarch, **King Marek I**, after himself and the capital city. Following Marek’s death, the kingdom is currently governed by a ruling council, awaiting the emergence of a legitimate heir.

### **1. Historical Overview**

#### **Pre-Imperial Era (Bolborkia)**

The region now known as Ka was originally inhabited by the **Bolborkians**, a human tribal group culturally distinct from the Erulians. Historical records indicate longstanding hostility and competition between the two peoples.

#### **Imperial Conquest (74 A.H.)**

In **74 A.H.**, **Emperor Talios I** invaded Bolborkia, defeating local resistance and incorporating the territory into the expanding Erulian Empire. For centuries the region remained under direct imperial rule, though local identity persisted.

#### **Restoration of Independence (516 A.H.)**

The first King of Bolborkia, **Joriel I**, led a full-scale rebellion against imperial authority. After a **four-week siege of the capital city, Ka**, the empire was expelled and the region regained independence.

#### **Renaming to Kingdom of Ka**

Under the later rule of **King Marek I**, the nation was renamed **the Kingdom of Ka**, honoring both the capital and his personal legacy.

#### **Current State**

After Marek's death, no direct heir was confirmed. The kingdom is now run by a council composed of former high-ranking officials of Marek’s regime. Despite holding the **largest territorial extent in its history**, Ka faces **economic decline and political stagnation** due to unclear succession.
