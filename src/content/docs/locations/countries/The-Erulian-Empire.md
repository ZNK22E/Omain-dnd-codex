## **Overview**

The **Erulian Empire** is the largest and oldest known political state in Omain, encompassing **19.0 million square kilometers** including its mainland territory on Droskarin and full control of the Shersian Archipelago. Originating from the tribal human culture of the **Erulians** in the region now known as **Erule**, the Empire has historically served as the dominant cultural, political, and religious force across the world.

## **Origins and Foundations**
The empire was founded by **Emperor Calados I** in **Year 0 of the Erulian Calendar**, an event marking the formal establishment of the empire, the creation of the **Hexadem religion**, and the introduction of the first recorded timekeeping system in Omain. The Erulian Calendar divides history into:

- **A.H. — After Hexadem** (from Year 0 onward)
    
- **B.H. — Before Hexadem** (dates prior to the empire’s founding)
    

Originally composed solely of the Erulian human tribe, the empire gradually expanded through conquest, colonization, religious influence, and integration, eventually evolving into a **multicultural imperial state** incorporating races, cultures, and regions beyond its homeland.

Throughout its history, the Erulian Empire has exerted control over vast regions of Omain, including large parts of both major continents. Its influence shaped global religion, language, trade, war, and governance. The empire is widely regarded as the primary architect of recorded world history and the standard-setter for calendars, diplomacy, and organized religion.

Although its land holdings have diminished significantly from their height, many nations trace cultural or historical roots back to Erulian rule.
## **Geography/Borders**

The mainland territory of the Erulian Empire is located on **Droskarin**, bordered by:

|Neighboring Region|Direction|
|---|---|
|**Kingdom of Ka**|West|
|**Kingdom of Kelar**|South|
|**Helskirk**|South|
|**Permatesh**|North|
|**Terra Fina Channel**|East|

In addition to continental borders, the empire **fully governs the Shersian Archipelago**, located between the Eastern and Western continents.

- **Mainland area:** 17.9 million km²
    
- **Shersian Archipelago:** 1.1 million km²
    
- **Total territory:** 19.0 million km²
    

Imperial naval infrastructure extends across both hemispheres and controls key maritime routes through the central channels of Omain.

Several major natural landmarks are located within or along the borders of the empire:

#### **Dead Man’s Lake**

Located on the border between Erule and the Kingdom of Ka. Named due to its long history as a battlefield and strategic conflict zone.

#### **Erulian Desert**

A vast desert east of the imperial heartland, extending into the foothills of the Western Draconic Mountains. Notable for its rare seasonal snowfall caused by elevation and wind patterns from the mountains.

#### **Erulian Plains**

An extensive grassland region covering much of the empire’s agricultural core. These plains served as the homeland of early Erulian tribes and later became the foundation of imperial expansion.
## **Politics & Factions**

The modern Erulian Empire is an **authoritarian state** ruled by **Empress Erolith I**, who holds total legal, political, military, and religious authority. Centralized power structures, strict imperial law, and institutional dominance reinforce the empire’s continued relevance, despite reduced territorial size.

- **Current size:** **19.0 million km²**
    
- **Status:** Smallest territorial extent in imperial history
    
- **Global role:** Still the dominant cultural and geopolitical power
    

The empire remains heavily centralized around Erule, its capital and spiritual birthplace.
## **Culture**

The culture of the **Erulian Empire** is characterized by a blend of ancient tribal lineage, imperial tradition, religious doctrine, and multicultural integration resulting from centuries of expansion. Originating from the ancestral Erulian peoples of the Erulian Plains, imperial culture has evolved into a refined, hierarchical, and tradition-driven society that places strong emphasis on heritage, faith, and national prestige.

Erulian culture is often described as expressive, ceremonial, and deeply historical, valuing artistry, military honor, religious devotion, and the preservation of imperial identity.

---

### **1. Social Values and Identity**

Erulian citizens are taught to view themselves as heirs of a long-standing civilizational legacy. Core cultural values include:

- **Honor and familial lineage**
    
- **Religious piety toward the Hexadem**
    
- **Patriotic loyalty to the Crown**
    
- **Formality in public conduct**
    
- **Personal valor and martial virtue**
    

Citizen identity is shaped by a belief in cultural destiny: that the empire serves as a civilizing force and steward of historical continuity across Omain.

---

### **2. Social Hierarchy**

While officially all imperial citizens share equal legal status under the Empress, social standing is informally influenced by:

- **Family reputation and noble lineage**
    
- **Military service**
    
- **Religious standing within Hexademic institutions**
    
- **Regional origin (Erule and old-core provinces viewed as elite)**
    

The nobility remains influential, though titles are increasingly ceremonial outside the capital.

---

### **3. Religion and Ritual Life**

The **Hexadem** permeates cultural practices, influencing:

- naming conventions
    
- holidays and national festivals
    
- burial rites
    
- oaths of service
    
- architecture
    

Priestly orders hold high authority, and major life events (birth, ascension to adulthood, marriage, military commissioning) are traditionally accompanied by religious ceremonies.

---

### **4. Art, Literature & Expression**

Erulian artistic culture is renowned for:

- **grand religious murals**
    
- **epic poetry chronicling imperial conquest**
    
- **ornate architecture with arches, spires, and sun motifs**
    
- **vibrant court music featuring stringed and percussive instruments**
    
- **ceremonial dances performed during national holidays**
    

Art is often propagandistic, serving to reinforce imperial mythology and divine legitimacy.

---

### **5. Language & Naming Traditions**

The **Erulian language** forms the administrative and cultural backbone of the empire. Names often feature:

- elongated vowels
    
- ancestral surnames tied to regions
    
- honorifics referencing divine or noble lineage
    

Example structural patterns (fictional):

- _Calados er-Valien_ ("of the Valien line")
    
- _Erolith Sa’an_ ("sanctified/ordained")
    

---

### **6. Food & Cuisine**

Imperial cuisine is diverse due to centuries of territorial expansion. Notable culinary elements include:

- **rich spiced meats and stews**
    
- **coastal salt-cured seafoods**
    
- **strong wines and fruit liqueurs**
    
- **bread-based staples flavored with oils and herbs**
    
- **ceremonial festival feasts featuring roasted game and sweet pastries**
    

Meals are social events emphasizing hospitality, storytelling, and music.

---

### **7. Diplomacy & Cultural Attitude Toward Others**

The empire sees itself as a civilizing authority, which influences foreign relations. Imperial diplomacy often combines:

- **religious proselytization**
    
- **cultural assimilation**
    
- **military imposition when "civil order" is deemed necessary**
    

Foreign cultures may be respected, but particularly on imperial terms—absorbed, documented, and reframed through Erulian ideology.

---

### **8. Military Culture**

Military service is seen as a path to honor, citizenship status, and upward mobility. Soldiers are:

- ceremonially blessed before major campaigns
    
- awarded legacy titles linked to bloodlines
    
- expected to display courage in death rather than retreat
    

Festivals often commemorate ancient victories.

---

- **religious conversion**
    
- **architectural styles**
    
- **legal codification and bureaucracy**
    
- **language adoption**
    
- **trade networks and naval treaties**
    

Much of Omain’s recorded history is archived in Erulian script.

---

### **10. Cultural Tension**

As the empire declines territorially and shifts to a multicultural population, tension arises between:

- traditionalists seeking purification of imperial heritage
    
- pragmatists advocating integration of non-Erulian customs
    
- conquered peoples reclaiming indigenous identity
    

These conflicts shape modern politics and ideology.

## **Law of the Erulian Empire**

The legal system of the **Erulian Empire** is a centralized, authoritarian framework rooted in religious doctrine, imperial authority, and centuries of codified legal tradition. Although influenced by regional customs during various eras of expansion, the modern system is unified under the authority of the Empress and enforced through standardized courts, military tribunals, and local magistrates.

Imperial law serves not only as a tool for order but as a means of preserving cultural identity, legitimizing rule, and maintaining religious adherence.

---

### **1. Foundations of Law**

Erulian law is based on three core sources:

|Source|Description|Authority|
|---|---|---|
|**Imperial Decree**|Laws declared directly by the Empress; highest legal authority.|Absolute, unquestionable.|
|**Hexademic Doctrine**|Religious laws derived from Hexadem scripture and priestly interpretation.|Enforced by both clergy & state.|
|**The Codex Erulian**|A written body of unified civil and military law developed over centuries.|Legal standard across empire.|

While the Codex governs everyday matters such as property and crime, imperial decrees may override all prior laws instantly.

---

### **2. Structure of the Legal System**

#### **Supreme Authority**

- **Empress holds full legal power**
    
- Can issue laws without approval
    
- Can overrule court decisions arbitrarily
    

#### **Enforcement Bodies**

|Institution|Function|
|---|---|
|**Imperial Courts**|Civil and criminal trials; primary judiciary.|
|**Hexademic Tribunals**|Handle religious crimes, heresy, relic theft, and sacred disputes.|
|**Military Courts**|Govern soldiers, wartime crimes, treason, and rebellion.|
|**Local Magistrates**|Enforce law in provinces; answer directly to imperial overseers.|

All courts operate under the assumption of loyalty to the Crown and faith.

---

### **3. Legal Principles**

Key philosophical tenets of Erulian law include:

- **Law serves the empire, not the individual**
    
- **Loyalty to crown supersedes local rights**
    
- **Religion and law are inseparable**
    
- **Crime against the state is worse than crime against citizens**
    
- **Foreigners have fewer legal protections than citizens**
    
- **Honor and testimony are legally binding oaths**
    

Justice is seen not as impartial, but moral and ideological.

---

### **4. Rights and Status**

|Class|Legal Status|
|---|---|
|**Imperial Nobility**|Holds privileges, lighter sentences, political immunity in certain cases.|
|**Citizens of the Empire**|Full legal protection and trial rights.|
|**Subjects of Conquered Lands**|Partial rights; can gain citizenship through service or loyalty.|
|**Non-Citizens / Foreigners**|Limited protections; judged under imperial rather than local law.|
|**Heretics, Rebels, Enemies of the Crown**|No rights; may be executed without trial.|

---

### **5. Categories of Crime**

Erulian law divides crimes into three classes:

#### **A. Crimes Against the Crown**

- treason
    
- rebellion
    
- harboring fugitives
    
- espionage

**Punishment:** execution, exile, forced labor, erasure of family status.

#### **B. Religious Crimes**

- heresy (denying Hexadem doctrine)

- theft
    
- murder
    
- land disputes
    
- fraud
    
- property destruction
    

**Punishment:** fines, imprisonment, corporal punishment, restitution.

---

### **6. Punishments**

Punishments vary by class and severity:

|Punishment|Typical Use|

|**Imprisonment**|Short- to mid-term confinement; rehabilitation not prioritized.|
|**Labor Sentences**|Mines, military roads, shipbuilding.|
|**Branding or Mutilation**|Marking criminals, especially thieves or heretics.|
|**Execution**|Treason, heresy, murder, rebellion.|
|**Honor Trials**|Duel-like redemptive trials for nobles or soldiers.|

Executions may be carried out publicly to demonstrate imperial power.

### **7. Notable Laws (Examples)**

These can be expanded into full articles later.

- **Writ of Maritime Rule** — Imperial naval authority supersedes local sea laws.
    

---

### **8. Cultural Attitudes Toward Justice**

Erulians do not view law as impartial or egalitarian. Justice is seen as:

- **an extension of divine order**
    
- **a reinforcement of hierarchy**
    
- **a tool for protecting the empire’s legacy**
    

Many citizens accept harsh justice as necessary for stability.

## **Military of the Erulian Empire**

The military forces of the **Erulian Empire**, collectively known as the **Inquisition**, constitute a fully religion-based martial institution operating under the doctrines of the Hexadem. Unlike conventional armies, the Erulian military is considered a sacred order, and all soldiers are regarded as **Inquisitors**, each baptized into one of six holy regiments corresponding to their patron deity.

Military service is viewed as both a spiritual duty and a ceremonial path to honor, with each regiment operating as both a religious order and a combat formation. The military's primary purpose is not only warfare, but expansion, ideological enforcement, and preservation of imperial divine authority.

---

### **1. Military Size and Structure**

|Classification|Personnel|
|---|---|
|**Active Inquisitors**|~3.2 million|
|**Reserve Forces**|~4.5 million|
|**Auxiliary & Support Staff**|~2.3 million|

Inquisitors are organized into a tiered system:

- **Regiment (aligned to deity)** → comprised of Legions
    
- **Legions** → comprised of Battalions
    
- **Battalions** → comprised of Squadrons
    
- **Squadrons** → comprised of Cells (smallest functional unit)

The empire fights wars through sequential regimental coordination:

1. **Tetford** plans the campaign
    
2. **Tiamat** breaks the enemy
