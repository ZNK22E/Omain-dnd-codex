## Overview

**Erulian** is a major human language of **Omain** and the official tongue of several prominent nations, including the **Erulian Empire** itself. It is the **second most widely spoken language in the world**, following **Common**, and functions as a prestige language of religion, administration, diplomacy, and scholarship.

Erulian is spoken natively and officially in:

- **Erulian Empire**
    
- **Kingdom of Ka**
    
- **Uxbrid**
    
- **Helskirk**
    
- **Shersia**
    

In many regions, it coexists with local tongues, but Erulian remains the dominant written and liturgical language of the Hexadem.

Approximate global usage (including second-language speakers):

- **Common:** spoken by ~80% of Omain’s population
    
- **Erulian:** spoken by ~60% of Omain’s population
    

Most educated individuals outside isolated cultures (like Grantia and some deep tribal regions) understand at least basic Erulian.

## Historical Origins

The Erulian language descends from an ancient human tongue known as **Old Orisian**, the language of the first settled humans before they fragmented into migratory tribes.

- **Old Orisian** was a broad, flexible language used across early Omain.
    
- As tribes split and scattered, Old Orisian branched into several proto-dialects.
    
- One of these branches evolved in northeastern Droskarin and became **Early Erulian**, the speech of the people who would later form the kingdom (and then empire) of **Erule**.
    

When **King Calados I** was crowned and the **Hexadem** formalized, Erulian became:

- the **liturgical** language of the Seven Books,
    
- the **administrative** language of the first organized nation, and later
    
- the **imperial** language of the Erulian Empire.
    

Over centuries of imperial expansion, Erulian spread as:

- the language of **record-keeping, law, and military orders**,
    
- the tongue of **education and literacy**, and
    
- the default spoken language in conquered or closely allied regions.

## Phonology and Sound

Erulian is a **consonant-rich, moderately vowel-balanced** language with clear syllable structure and a fairly regular stress pattern.

### Vowels

Erulian has **five primary vowels**, each with short and long forms:

- **a / ā** – as in _“far”_
    
- **e / ē** – as in _“bed”_ / _“they”_
    
- **i / ī** – as in _“hit”_ / _“machine”_
    
- **o / ō** – as in _“lot”_ / _“more”_
    
- **u / ū** – as in _“put”_ / _“flute”_
    

Diphthongs (like _ai, au, ei_) occur but are relatively rare and usually signal older or formal words.

### Consonants

Common consonants include:

- Plosives: **p, b, t, d, k, g**
    
- Fricatives: **f, v, s, z, sh (š), h**
    
- Nasals: **m, n**
    
- Liquids: **l, r**
    
- Approximants: **y (j), w**
    

Erulian **r** is typically trilled or tapped; **sh (š)** is common in older formal terms and names (_Hexadem, Shersia, Shar_).

### Stress and Rhythm

- Stress usually falls on the **second-to-last syllable** (penultimate stress).
    
- Compound and borrowed words may shift stress for clarity.
    

This gives Erulian a measured but expressive rhythm that works well for formal proclamations and religious recitation.

## Writing System

The Erulian language is written in the **Erulic script**, a left-to-right alphabet derived from stylized forms of Old Orisian rune-marks.

### Alphabet

The modern Erulian alphabet uses **24 primary letters**, with a few digraphs and diacritics for older or sacred spellings. It is roughly equivalent in density to a simple Latin-like script.

Example (transliterated):

> **A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, Š, T, U, V, Y, Z**

- **Š (sh)** is treated as a separate letter, important in religious terms and proper nouns.
    
- There is no separate “c” in native words; sounds are covered by **k** or **s**.
    
- Sacred names often preserve archaic spellings (e.g., _Tetfard_ → _Tetford_ in modern pronunciation).
    

### Usage

- **Formal script** is used for imperial decrees, temple inscriptions, and the Seven Books.
    
- **Everyday script** is a simplified, more rounded variant used in letters, signage, and common records.
    

In the Erulian Empire and Ka, literacy in Erulian is a major marker of social standing.

## Dialects and Regional Variation

While the written standard is relatively unified (centered on **High Erulian of Erule**), spoken Erulian includes several notable regional varieties:

- **Imperial Erulian (Erule / Heartland)**  
    Considered the “standard”; used in court, clergy, and education.
    
- **Ka-Erulian**  
    Spoken in the **Kingdom of Ka**. It retains some old Bolborkian phrasing, a slightly rougher consonant usage, and a more clipped rhythm.
    
- **Shersian Erulian**  
    Mixed with loanwords from orcish and local island tongues; used as a trade and administrative language.
    
- **Uxbrid Erulian**  
    Influenced by Common and local dialects; used heavily in commerce and politics. Some Hexalemis terms also appear here.
    
- **Helskirk Erulian**  
    Retains archaic formal vocabulary and is somewhat more conservative; strong presence in military and noble contexts.
    

Despite these differences, all dialects remain **mutually intelligible**, and most educated speakers can easily adjust between local speech and High Erulian.

## Global Speaker Distribution

Based on the current estimated population of Omain:

- Around **60%** of the world’s population can speak Erulian **to some degree** (native or as a second language).
    
- Roughly **35–40%** speak it as a **native tongue**, concentrated in:
    
    - Core provinces of the Erulian Empire
        
    - Most of Ka’s urban centers
        
    - Major cities in Uxbrid and Helskirk
        
    - Shersian colonial settlements
        

This makes Erulian:

- **The second most spoken language in the world**, after **Common**
    
- The primary language of **imperial culture, Hexademic religion, and high education**
