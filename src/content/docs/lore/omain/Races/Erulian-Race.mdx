## **Overview**
![Erulian Race](/Images/Races/Erulian-Race.png)
(_Erulian Male and Erulian Female Side By Side_)

The **Erulian** race is a prominent human subrace native to the **northwestern plains of Droskarin**, specifically the region surrounding the ancient heartland of **Erule**. They developed as an adaptive offshoot of the early human populations of Omain, shaped by the climate, terrain, and cultural pressures of the early Erulian homeland.

Today, Erulians are one of the **most widespread human lineages** in Omain. Due to centuries of imperial expansion, colonization, migration, and intermarriage, Erulian ancestry is found across nearly every human population on the planet.

The Erulian Empire’s long history has ensured that **Erulian features, cultural practices, and bloodlines** appear from Virelya to the Shersian Archipelago—making them one of the most globally influential human subraces.

# **Origins and Early Development**

The Erulian race traces its roots to the **ancient humans of Droskarin**, the earliest settled populations during the Greater Era of Population. These ancestral humans spoke **Old Orisian**, lived in scattered clans, and eventually diverged through migration.

The tribes that wandered northwest toward what would become **the Erulian Plains** underwent several key adaptations:

### **Environmental Pressures**

- **Warm climates** in summer and **harsh winds** in colder seasons forced the development of balanced pigmentation.
    
- **Open plains and wide horizons** fostered a lifestyle of farming, horse rearing, and settlement building.
    
- **Coastal humidity** near the Terra Fina Channel contributed to robust lung capacity and endurance.
    

### **Social Pressures**

- Early Erulians lived in clustered settlements but regularly interacted with nomads, shaping their adaptability, language complexity, and organized social structure.
    
- Their ancestor societies placed heavy value on **craftsmanship, honor, and communal responsibility**, traits still recognizable today in Erulian culture.
    

By the time **King Calados I** unified the region during Year 0 A.H., the Erulian race had crystallized into a distinct human lineage.

# **Physical Characteristics**

Erulians maintain several characteristic traits shaped by their ancestral homeland:

### **Skin Tone**

- Generally **light-skinned**, but **tan easily** under sun exposure.
    
- This derives from the need to withstand the **intense summer heat** of the plains while still thriving in cooler months.
    

### **Hair**

- Naturally dark: **brown, deep chestnut, or black** are the most common.
    
- Occasionally lighter shades appear through generational mixing.
    

### **Eye Color**

- Predominantly **hazel, brown, or green**.
    
- Blue eyes are rare but more common in regions closer to northern migrant groups.
    

### **Build**

- Medium height on average.
    
- Tend to be **lean but strong**, a result of historically agricultural and martial traditions.
    

### **Facial Structure**

- Defined cheekbones, straight or slightly curved noses, and expressive brows.
    
- Warm facial complexion that deepens easily in sunlight.

# **Cultural Traits and Identity**

Erulian identity is tied to:

- **Imperial legacy**
    
- **Hexademic faith**
    
- **Community and tradition**
    
- **Scholarship and structured society**
    

Because the Erulian Empire dominated three continents for centuries, the race’s cultural markers—language, customs, and aesthetics—spread quickly and rooted firmly across Omain.

# **Adaptations to the Erulian Plains**

The Erulian Plains are a region of:

- Hot summers
    
- Wind-heavy winters
    
- Long stretches of fertile grassland
    
- Seasonal storms from the Terra Fina Channel
    

Erulians adapted in several ways:

### **1. Pigmentation Flexibility**

Their skin reflects a balance between protection from summer sun and efficiency in capturing sunlight during colder months—resulting in a complexion that **tans quickly without burning easily**.

### **2. Heat Endurance**

Generations on the plains developed:

- Strong cardiovascular stamina
    
- High tolerance for heat
    
- Ability to work long hours outdoors, especially during harvest seasons
    

### **3. Respiratory Adaptation**

The humid coastal winds strengthened:

- Lung capacity
    
- Breath control
    
- Endurance during physical tasks
    

These traits made Erulians well-suited for early military and agricultural development.

### **4. Social Cohesion**

Their environment encouraged:

- Permanent settlements
    
- Cooperative defense
    
- Early political organization
    

This is one reason Erulians were the first to form a cohesive kingdom—and later an empire.

---

# **Modern Distribution**

Due to the Erulian Empire’s historical reach, Erulian bloodlines are widespread.

### **High Concentration Regions**

- **Erulian Empire (core provinces)**
    
- **Kingdom of Ka**
    
- **Uxbrid**
    
- **Helskirk**
    
- **Shersia**
    

### **Moderate Presence**

- Thaxted
    
- Hatland
    
- Permatesh
    
- Garenia
    

### **Low but Present**

- Virelya (outer regions)
    
- Certain parts of Chilborkia
    
- Kelar (mostly through migration, as dragons rarely intermix genetically)
    

### **Global Percentage**

Approximately **55–60% of all humans in Omain** carry at least **partial Erulian ancestry**, and about **35%** can be classified as primarily Erulian ethnicity.

---

# **Relationship to Other Human Subraces**

Due to centuries of interaction, Erulians influenced or intermixed with:

- **Bolborkians** in Ka
    
- **Uxbridian coastal humans**
    
- **Permateshian forest people**
    
- **Helskirk mountain-dwelling humans**
    

This mixing created a human “web of ancestry” where pure traits are rare outside isolated pockets.

---

# **Cultural Influence**

Erulians introduced or standardized:

- The **Erulian Calendar**
    
- Hexademic liturgy
    
- Early forms of naval engineering
    
- Organized infantry structures (later replaced by Inquisitors)
    
- Widespread agricultural techniques
    

Their influence on world politics and culture is unmatched except by Grantian technology (which remains isolated).## **Overview**
