## **Introduction**
### _The Oldest Planet in the Orialis Universe_

**Omain** is the oldest known planet within the **Orialis Universe**, with a recorded mytho-historical age of approximately **5,000 years**. Regarded as the **cradle of Humanity and its subspecies**, the planet is bound to a divine legacy shaped by creation, extinction, restoration, and global expansion.

Its long chronology is divided into **four major eras**, each defined by the actions of primordial gods and the civilizations that emerged from them. These eras form the foundation of Omain’s cosmic identity and the development of all known life.
## **Ages & Eras**

The recorded history of **Omain**, the oldest known planet in the Orialis Universe, is divided into **four major eras**. Each era marks a profound shift in the planet’s divine, biological, and civilizational structure—from cosmic creation to extinction, rebirth, and global expansion.

---

### **1. Era of Creation**

#### _Prehistory — Years 0–3000_

**Founder Deity:** **Orialis**, the Prime Creator

The Era of Creation represents the birth and formation of Omain. Over three millennia, Orialis forged the planet from cosmic essence—shaping continents, seas, elemental cycles, and the fundamental layers of the world. In its final centuries, Orialis created the **Huminitas**, proto-humans who would become the ancestors of modern Humanity and its many subspecies.

This era ends as the first sentient beings awaken and primitive civilization begins to take form.

---

### **2. Lower Era of Population**

#### _Prehistory — Years 3000–3243_

**Key Event:** **The Death of Orialis**

Following the creation of the Huminitas, life flourished across Omain. Early tribes, primitive societies, and the foundations of culture began to appear. However, this era ended abruptly and violently: the death of Orialis triggered a catastrophic divine backlash that **wiped out all life on the planet**.

Omain returned to silence, its surface barren, awaiting restoration.

---

### **3. Greater Era of Population**

#### _Years 3243–3507_

**Restoration Deity:** **Drorialis**, Consort of Orialis

In grief for Orialis and defiance of oblivion, Drorialis breathed life back into the dead world. To protect the planet from another collapse, Drorialis created six divine entities—known collectively as the **Hexadem**—each responsible for governing a fundamental aspect of existence:

- **Tiamat** — Goddess of Reality
    
- **Shar** — God of Space
    
- **Oghma** — God of Soul and Mind
    
- **Eldath** — Goddess of Fate
    
- **Auriel** — Goddess of the Elements
    
- **Tetford** — God of Time
    

Together, these gods repopulated Omain with renewed **Humanity** and crafted the **subspecies** that would later fill its continents. They stabilized the metaphysical structure of the planet and set the foundations for civilization.

The Greater Era ends with the founding of the **Erulian Empire**—the first global superpower—marking the beginning of recorded civilization.

---

### **4. Expansion Era**

#### _Years 3507–5014 (Ongoing)_

**Catalyst:** **Founding of the Erulian Empire**

The modern era begins with the rise of the Erulian Empire in the **northeast of Droskarin**, ushering in a period of rapid growth, cultural development, and geopolitical upheaval. The Empire unified vast territories under its authority, shaped global religion, introduced the **Erulian Calendar**, and accelerated technological advancement.

This era, still ongoing, is defined by:

- political conflict among newly formed nations
    
- the spread of Erulian culture and influence
    
- divine intervention through the Hexadem
    
- exploration, migration, and territorial expansion
    
- increasing complexity of global civilization
    

The Expansion Era remains the active chapter of Omain’s history.

## **Geography** 

**Omain** is a two-continent world characterized by a layered planetary structure, limited oceanic bodies, and a central island region known as Sershia. The planet features a complex subsurface environment and distinct maritime divisions between its major landmasses.

---

### **1. Continents**

Omain is divided into **two primary continents**:

- **Western Continent: Virelya**
    
- **Eastern Continent: Droskarin**
    

The continents are separated by marine channels and host the majority of known land-based civilizations. Their exact borders, landforms, and political divisions vary by region and era.

#### **Sershia Island**

Between the Western and Eastern continents lies the island of **Sershia**, positioned roughly at the midpoint of the world’s central maritime divide. The island holds strategic geographic significance and serves as a cultural and navigational crossroads.

#### **Shersian Archipelago**

North of Sershia is the **Shersian Archipelago**, a chain of **over 50 islands** of varied size and composition. The archipelago forms a major nautical region and marks the northern extent of the central land–sea basin.

---

### **2. Seas and Oceans**

Omain contains relatively few large bodies of water compared to Earth-like worlds. The major marine divisions include:

#### **Major Oceans**

- **Grand Southern Ocean** — Occupies the southern hemisphere and forms the largest continuous body of water on the planet.
    
- **Grand Northern Ocean** — The northern counterpart to the southern ocean, bordering northern continental coasts and maritime territories.
    

#### **Important Seas and Channels**

- **Shersian Channel** — A central sea separating the continents on the Sershia side, spanning both Sershia and the Shersian Archipelago.
    
- **Terra Fina Channel** — A second major maritime passage dividing the continents on the opposite side from Sershia.
    

These channels form the primary boundaries between the Western and Eastern continents and serve as major nautical trade and migration routes.

---

### **3. Planetary Structure**

Omain is composed of **four major geological layers**, extending from surface to core:

|Layer|Depth|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Overworld**|Surface level|The inhabited surface of the world, consisting of continents, islands, oceans, and surface biomes.|
|**Underdark**|~13 km below surface|A vast cavernous layer spanning approximately **60% of the planet’s internal volume**. Contains extensive subterranean ecosystems, tunnel networks, and large subterranean chambers.|
|**Mantle**|~40 km below Underdark|Behaves similarly to Earth's mantle, consisting of high-temperature molten and semi-molten rock.|
|**Core**|Several thousand kilometers below mantle|Functions analogously to Earth's core, with extreme heat and pressure influencing tectonics and magical/geologic phenomena (details unknown or debated).|

The existence of the **Underdark layer**, significantly larger than typical subterranean cave systems, distinguishes Omain from Earth and contributes to unique geological, ecological, and cultural developments.

---
## **Major Powers**
The nations of **Omain** form a complex geopolitical landscape shaped by ancient history, divine intervention, cultural divergence, and centuries of territorial conflict. While dozens of realms exist across the world, only a select group are recognized as **major powers**, based on their economic output, military capability, political influence, and global reach.

Grantia is **intentionally excluded** from all rankings due to its unique draconic population and its non-participation in global economic or military systems.

## **Magic & Technology**

Magic is a **universal and accepted phenomenon** present across all nations. It is neither feared nor outlawed, and most societies treat it as a natural extension of the world—similar to any other field of study or profession.

### **Nature of Magic**

- Draws from elemental, spiritual, spatial, temporal, and metaphysical forces shaped by the **Six Gods**.
    
- Users vary from minor practitioners to powerful archmages.
    
- Magic is unpredictable, dangerous, and requires both discipline and innate potential.
    

### **Where Magic Is Studied**

Magic is taught and researched in:

- **Dedicated academies**
    
- **Universities**
    
- **Private arcane colleges**
    
- **Religious institutions tied to the Hexadem**
    

Every major nation possesses at least one formal magical school, though quality, prestige, and approach differ greatly.

### **Role of Magic in Society**

- Used in healing, warding, enchantment, agriculture, architecture, and defense.
    
- Magic-users may serve as:
    
    - court mages
        
    - battle casters
        
    - scholars
        
    - healers
        
    - elemental manipulators
        
    - researchers
        

Magic plays a foundational role in Omain’s culture and infrastructure, though it remains taxing and difficult to master.

---

### 🛡️ **The Exception: Grantia**

**Grantia** stands alone as an anomaly in Omain’s magic–technology balance.

#### **1. Origin**

- Grantia originates from **another world entirely**, bringing with it an **ultra-advanced civilization**.
    

#### **2. Technology**

Grantians possess technological capabilities centuries beyond Omain, including:

- advanced metallurgy
    
- efficient energy systems
    
- sophisticated medicine
    
- engineered constructs
    
- advanced communication networks
    
- intricate transportation machinery
    

Their technology often appears “magical” to outsiders despite being purely scientific.

#### **3. Grantians and Magic**

- **Grantians cannot cast magic.**  
    They lack the metaphysical structure necessary to channel arcane energy.
    
- Despite this, their technology is so advanced that it often surpasses magical capabilities in reliability and power.
    

#### **4. Political and Ethical Restrictions**

Grantia is governed by a **strict constitutional doctrine** that forbids it from:

- sharing advanced technology
    
- interfering militarily with foreign nations
    
- influencing global political structures
    
- altering the natural arcane–technological balance of Omain
    

Because of these restrictions:

- Grantia does **not** participate in wealth or military rankings.
    
- It engages only in limited **resource trade** and formal **diplomatic exchanges**.
    
- It remains an **isolated superpower**—in theory unmatched, but in practice entirely neutral.

### ⚔️ **Summary**

|Field|State in Omain|
|---|---|
|**General Technology**|Medieval; slow development|
|**Gunpowder Use**|Cannons & artillery only|
|**Medicine**|High disparity between poor and rich|
|**Magic**|Common, institutionalized, academically studied|
|**Grantia**|Ultratech, non-magical, constitutionally isolated|

Omain is a world where **magic fills the gaps left by limited technology**, and technology slowly advances around magic—while one isolated nation stands quietly centuries ahead of all others.
