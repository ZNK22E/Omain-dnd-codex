## **Introduction**
### _The Oldest Planet in the Orialis Universe_

**Omain** is the oldest known planet within the **Orialis Universe**, with a recorded mytho-historical age of approximately **5,000 years**. Regarded as the **cradle of Humanity and its subspecies**, the planet is bound to a divine legacy shaped by creation, extinction, restoration, and global expansion.

Its long chronology is divided into **four major eras**, each defined by the actions of primordial gods and the civilizations that emerged from them. These eras form the foundation of Omain’s cosmic identity and the development of all known life.
## **Ages & Eras**

The recorded history of **Omain**, the oldest known planet in the Orialis Universe, is divided into **four major eras**. Each era marks a profound shift in the planet’s divine, biological, and civilizational structure—from cosmic creation to extinction, rebirth, and global expansion.

## **1. Era of Creation**

### _Prehistory — Years 0–3000_

**Founder Deity:** **Orialis**, the Prime Creator

The Era of Creation represents the birth and formation of Omain. Over three millennia, Orialis forged the planet from cosmic essence—shaping continents, seas, elemental cycles, and the fundamental layers of the world. In its final centuries, Orialis created the **Huminitas**, proto-humans who would become the ancestors of modern Humanity and its many subspecies.

This era ends as the first sentient beings awaken and primitive civilization begins to take form.

## **2. Lower Era of Population**

### _Prehistory — Years 3000–3243_

**Key Event:** **The Death of Orialis**

Following the creation of the Huminitas, life flourished across Omain. Early tribes, primitive societies, and the foundations of culture began to appear. However, this era ended abruptly and violently: the death of Orialis triggered a catastrophic divine backlash that **wiped out all life on the planet**.

Omain returned to silence, its surface barren, awaiting restoration.

## **3. Greater Era of Population**

### _Years 3243–3507_

**Restoration Deity:** **Drorialis**, Consort of Orialis

In grief for Orialis and defiance of oblivion, Drorialis breathed life back into the dead world. To protect the planet from another collapse, Drorialis created six divine entities—known collectively as the **Hexadem**—each responsible for governing a fundamental aspect of existence:

- **Tiamat** — Goddess of Reality
    
- **Shar** — God of Space
    
- **Oghma** — God of Soul and Mind
    
- **Eldath** — Goddess of Fate
    
- **Auriel** — Goddess of the Elements
    
- **Tetford** — God of Time
    

Together, these gods repopulated Omain with renewed **Humanity** and crafted the **subspecies** that would later fill its continents. They stabilized the metaphysical structure of the planet and set the foundations for civilization.

The Greater Era ends with the founding of the **Erulian Empire**—the first global superpower—marking the beginning of recorded civilization.

## **4. Expansion Era**

### _Years 3507–5014 (Ongoing)_

**Catalyst:** **Founding of the Erulian Empire**

The modern era begins with the rise of the Erulian Empire in the **northeast of Droskarin**, ushering in a period of rapid growth, cultural development, and geopolitical upheaval. The Empire unified vast territories under its authority, shaped global religion, introduced the **Erulian Calendar**, and accelerated technological advancement.

This era, still ongoing, is defined by:

- political conflict among newly formed nations
    
- the spread of Erulian culture and influence
    
- divine intervention through the Hexadem
    
- exploration, migration, and territorial expansion
    
- increasing complexity of global civilization
    

The Expansion Era remains the active chapter of Omain’s history.
