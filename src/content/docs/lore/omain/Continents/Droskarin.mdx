## **(Eastern Continent)**

**Droskarin** is the largest continent on <a href="/lore/omain/omain">Omain</a>, covering approximately **41.3 million square kilometers**. Known poetically as the **Old Continent**, Droskarin is historically regarded as the cultural and political cradle of the **<a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erulian Empire</a>** and the birthplace of the **<a href="/lore/religions/hexadem">Hexadem</a> faith**. Although originally home to diverse tribes and species, human civilizations—particularly the Empire of <a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erule</a>—eventually became dominant and shaped the continent’s recorded history.

---

### **1. Historical Overview**

Droskarin has been inhabited since antiquity by various tribal societies of differing races and cultures. However, the continent entered unified historical record in **Year 0 of the <a href="/lore/omain/calendars/erulian-calendar">Erulian Calendar</a>**, when **Calados I** founded the **Human Empire of <a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erule</a>**. The empire’s establishment marked the rise of a centralized human hegemony and the formal creation of the **<a href="/lore/religions/hexadem">Hexadem</a>**, a religious order that became the continent's primary spiritual tradition.

Over successive centuries, imperial expansion fractured and reorganized, resulting in the modern collection of sovereign states present today.

### **2. Political Divisions**

Droskarin comprises **six modern nations**, each varying in landmass and geological character. Approximate territorial distribution is as follows:

| Country              | Relative Size | Approx. Area (km²)   | Notes                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **<a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erulian Empire</a>**   | Largest       | **17.9 million km²** | Birthplace of <a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erule</a> and cultural center of the continent. |
| **<a href="/locations/countries/kingdom-of-ka">Kingdom of Ka</a>**    | Large         | **8.4 million km²**  | Contains Tiamat’s Rest; borders <a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erule</a>.                    |
| **<a href="/locations/countries/kingdom-of-kelar">Kingdom of Kelar</a>** | Medium–Large  | **7.9 million km²**  | Dominated by the Eastern Draconic Mountains.              |
| **Helskirk**         | Medium        | **4.1 million km²**  | Known for "floating" mountain formations.                 |
| **Permatesh**        | Medium–Small  | **2.3 million km²**  | Covered primarily by dense forest biomes.                 |
| **Chilborkia**       | Smallest      | **0.7 million km²**  | Mineral-rich valleys mined extensively by dwarves.        |

These modern borders emerged after multiple imperial partitions and cultural migrations.

### **3. Major Geological Features**

#### **Eastern Draconic Mountains**

Located primarily in **<a href="/locations/countries/kingdom-of-kelar">Kelar</a>**, this massive range covers **approximately 67%** of the kingdom’s territory. It includes the highest known peak on <a href="/lore/omain/omain">Omain</a>:

- **Tetford’s Peak** — _6,924 meters tall_ (highest recorded elevation globally).
    

The range influences regional climate and serves as both a natural barrier and cultural landmark.

---

#### **Erulian Desert**

Situated east of the <a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erulian Empire</a> and at the foothills of the Eastern Draconic Mountains. Due to the elevation and wind patterns of the mountains, **the northern sector experiences seasonal snowfall**, creating rare cold-desert biomes.

This region holds religious and archaeological significance due to early <a href="/lore/religions/hexadem">Hexadem</a> settlements.

---

#### **Mineral and Metal Valleys of Chilborkia**

A series of deep-cut valley networks rich in ores, crystalline deposits, and alloy-bearing rocks. Extensively mined by dwarven populations since pre-imperial times, the region remains economically vital despite its small size.

---

#### **Forest of Permatesh**

A vast temperate-to-tropical forest ecosystem covering most of **Permatesh**. Known for dense canopy cover, biodiverse wildlife, and ancient sacred groves tied to pre-imperial religions.

---

#### **Tiamat’s Rest**

A major pilgrimage sanctuary situated on the border between the <a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erulian Empire</a> and the territory of the **<a href="/locations/countries/kingdom-of-ka">Kingdom of Ka</a>**. Considered a spiritually neutral site, it is associated with <a href="/lore/religions/hexadem">Hexadem</a> cosmology and ancient draconic myth.

---

#### **Floating Mountains of Helskirk**

A collection of towering plateaus and sharp vertical cliff systems that _appear_ suspended above surrounding lowlands due to deep undercutting and erosion. Despite their name, the formations do not levitate but are geological illusions resulting from tectonic uplift and stone arches.

---

#### **Isle of Deadhis**

A tropical island located west of **Chilborkia’s** coastline. The island is geologically isolated, with unique flora and fauna, and historically avoided due to superstition and hazardous reef systems.

### **4. Summary**

Droskarin is defined by:

- **Its status as the cradle of the <a href="/locations/countries/the-erulian-empire">Erulian Empire</a> and <a href="/lore/religions/hexadem">Hexadem</a> religion**
    
- **Large-scale mountain systems and diverse biomes**
    
- **Six distinct nations with strong historical and geological identities**
    
- **The tallest mountain and largest desert on the planet**
    

As <a href="/lore/omain/omain">Omain</a>’s largest and oldest political center, Droskarin remains a defining force in global history, culture, and trade.
