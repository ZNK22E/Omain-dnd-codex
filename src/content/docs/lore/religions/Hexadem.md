## **Overview**

The **Hexadem** is the most widely practiced religion in the world of Omain and forms the spiritual backbone of its largest political power, the **Erulian Empire**. Originating over fifteen centuries ago, the faith began as a series of sacred pilgrimages undertaken by **seven prophets**, each guided by one of the six divine beings—Tiamat, Shar, Oghma, Eldath, Auriel, and Tetford—and by the memory of Orialis’ creation. These journeys produced the earliest Hexademic teachings and laid the foundation for the Seven Holy Books.

Within the **Erulian Empire**, the Hexadem is more than a faith—it is an _absolute institution_, intertwined with governance, culture, and law. Every imperial ruler is bound to its rites, and the faith’s doctrines shape nearly all aspects of Erulian society. Outside the empire, however, the Hexadem functions primarily as a spiritual practice. Its teachings are respected globally, but no foreign nation adopts the strict political integration seen in Erule.

Each year, followers from every corner of the world embark on **pilgrimages to the Seven Hexic Temples**, monumental sanctuaries dedicated to each deity. These pilgrimages are considered acts of devotion, reflection, and purification, and they form the heart of Hexademic religious life.

The Hexadem is governed by a centralized clerical hierarchy led by the **Grand Hex**, the supreme head of the faith. Supporting the Grand Hex are **five High Clerics**, each responsible for overseeing doctrinal interpretation, pilgrimage coordination, temple administration, and the preservation of the Seven Books. Together, they maintain theological unity and guide the faithful across the world.

## **Origins**
The Hexadem traces its beginnings to a series of sacred pilgrimages undertaken by **seven prophets**, each guided personally by one of the six divine beings (and by Tetford’s influence through time itself). These prophets, coming from vastly different walks of life, traveled across Omain, gathering divine knowledge, experiencing profound trials, and recording the foundations of what would become the **Seven Holy Books**.

When their individual journeys concluded, the prophets reconvened to unify their revelations into a single religion. From their collective work, the _Hexadem_ emerged as the dominant moral, spiritual, and cosmic doctrine of the world.

### **Prophet Joratho Vel**

#### _Author of the Book of the Massas_

Joratho Vel was an unusually long-lived man, reaching the age of **87**, whose pilgrimage centered on witnessing the journeys of the **Massas**, or _Choosen_, mortals favored directly by the gods. His writings record the six primordial Massas who shaped the early world:

- **Massa ke Auris** (chosen by Auriel) — brought **elemental stability**
    
- **Massa ke Zaar** (chosen by Shar) — brought **fear and the instinct to survive**
    
- **Massa ke Tiet** (chosen by Tiamat) — brought **spirituality and courage**
    
- **Massa ke Eldrad** (chosen by Eldath) — brought **compassion and inner strength**
    
- **Massa ke Oghun** (chosen by Oghma) — brought **intellect and innovation**
    
- **Massa ke Teft** (chosen by Tetford) — brought **awareness of time**
    

Joratho’s concluding passage introduces the prophecy of **Massa Hexademis**, a mortal “chosen by all six gods” who would one day rise to defend the world from a yet-unnamed calamity.

---

### **Emira Dhalos**

#### _Author of the Book of Auriel_

Emira Dhalos undertook a pilgrimage through the most remote natural places of Omain, guided by the shimmering light of **Auriel, Goddess of the Elements**. Traveling from volcanic caverns to deep-rooted forests, she chronicled her experiences and the elemental parables given by the goddess.

Her book emphasizes:

- elemental unity,
    
- natural equilibrium,
    
- and the awe of landscapes shaped by ancient forces.
    

She also recorded minor prophecies regarding elemental shifts, weather cycles, and rare alignments known only to dragons and elemental beings.

---

### **Teleron Vesh**

#### _Author of the Book of Shar_

Teleron Vesh was a reclusive, somber man fascinated by death, shadow, and forbidden magics. His pilgrimage began after the tragic death of his sister from a severe fever. Guided by **Shar, God of Space**, Teleron ventured into the darkest corners of magic seeking knowledge to resurrect her.

It was during this journey that Teleron inadvertently invented the earliest forms of **necromancy**—a practice later regulated strictly by the Hexadem and banned in most nations.

His book contains:

- accounts of Shar’s teachings on fear and dominance,
    
- lessons learned from forbidden magic,
    
- and elegies to his sister, written in sorrow.
    

---

### **Marrin and Kelvath Orun**

#### _Authors of the Books of Tiamat and Eldath_

Twin sisters Marrin and Kelvath Orun mirrored the duality of their guiding deities:

- **Marrin**, guided by **Tiamat**, pursued a path of valor, conflict, and fierce resolve.
    
- **Kelvath**, guided by **Eldath**, sought lives to heal, protect, and uplift.
    

Their pilgrimages remained separate until fate reunited them at a village under attack by a troll. Kelvath rushed to protect the villagers, and Marrin, arriving moments later, slew the troll—but not before it severed Kelvath’s arm. The injury symbolically mirrored **Eldath’s own missing arm**, a sacred motif of sacrifice and unity.

Together, the twins combined their experiences, stories, and the values of their respective deities into two interconnected books.

---

### **Seravus Morn**

#### _Author of the Book of Oghma_

Seravus Morn, a privileged thinker gifted with exceptional intellect, embarked on his pilgrimage to create “the most useful object imaginable.” For years he attempted countless inventions, all of which failed.

His revelation came by accident: when his horse collapsed under the weight of his components, Seravus designed the **wheel** and built the world’s first **wheel-cart** using salvaged materials.

His book documents:

- innovations shaped by Oghma’s inspiration,
    
- philosophical meditations on creation,
    
- and practical lessons in ingenuity, humility, and adaptation.
    

---

### **Eldra Vanton**

#### _Author of the Book of Tetford_

Eldra Vanton was the most mysterious of the prophets, living in near-total isolation. Few knew her personally, and her pilgrimage was undertaken entirely alone. Troubled by the idea that “the world moves yet no one counts its steps,” she sought closure through Tetford, the God of Time.

Her journey led her to develop:

- the first **Erulian Calendar**,
    
- the concept of quantified timekeeping,
    
- and the metaphysical foundations of temporal order.
    

Her book combines her sparse travels with enigmatic tales told by Tetford and the first treatises on time.

---

### **Unification of the Prophets**

Upon completing their sacred journeys, the seven prophets met once more and consolidated their revelations into the theological structure of the **Hexadem**. They:

1. **Founded the religion**,
    
2. **Selected Calados Aquabrand** as the first ruler of Erule,
    
3. **Finalized the Seven Holy Books**,
    
4. **Sanctified them collectively as _The Hexadem_**,
    
5. **Appointed the first Grand Hex and clergy**,
    
6. And finally, **departed into obscurity**, vanishing from history.
    

Their prophetic work remains the foundation of the oldest and most influential religion in Omain.
## **Holy Book/s**
### **The Seven Holy Books of the Hexadem**

#### **Overview**

The sacred canon of the Hexadem is composed of the **Seven Holy Books**, each authored by one of the seven prophets who founded the faith. Every book contains:

- the prophet’s recorded travels and hardships,
    
- the core **values** imparted by the guiding deity,
    
- a collection of **divine tales** spoken by the gods themselves or by the ancient **Massas**,
    
- and, in most cases, a concluding set of **prophecies** foretelling future cosmic or mortal events.
    

The only exception is the **Book of Oghma**, whose deity—valuing logic over foresight—refuses to provide prophecy of any form.

Together, the books form the textual foundation of the Hexademic faith, studied by clerics, pilgrims, and scholars across the world.

---

### **1. The Book of the Massas**

_Authored by Prophet **Joratho Vel**_

The oldest and most mythic of the Seven Books, it chronicles the journeys of the six original **Massas**, the divine Chosen who introduced foundational concepts to Omain:

- Massas of elemental stability, fear and survival, spirituality and courage, healing and strength, innovation, and time.
    

The book weaves their stories with Joratho’s own encounters and reflections, illustrating how the Massas shaped creation and mortal nature. It concludes with the famed prophecy of **Massa Hexademis**, a future Chosen blessed by all six gods to protect the world in an age of crisis.

---

### **2. The Book of Auriel**

_Authored by Prophet **Emira Dhalos**_

This book focuses on the **elemental balance** of Omain. Emira documents her descent into caverns, forests, volcanic chambers, and storm-wrought peaks, guided by Auriel’s luminescent presence.

Themes include:

- the harmony of natural forces,
    
- the cycles of storms, tides, and stone,
    
- and the quiet authority of the elemental world.
    

The book closes with prophecies tied to elemental disruptions and rare celestial alignments.

---

### **3. The Book of Shar**

_Authored by Prophet **Teleron Vesh**_

The darkest of the Seven Books, it explores fear, shadow, mortality, and the boundaries of forbidden magic. Teleron describes his desperate quest to revive his sister, the guidance he received from Shar, and the accidental creation of early necromancy.

The tales within recount Shar’s instruction on:

- dominance,
    
- the purpose of fear,
    
- and the cost of tampering with death.
    

Its prophecies warn of rising shadows, moral decay, and the dangers of ambition untempered by balance.

---

### **4. The Book of Tiamat**

_Authored by Prophet **Marrin Orun**_

Centered on valor, conflict, and righteous confrontation, this book follows Marrin’s journey through war-torn lands and perilous trials. Tiamat’s tales emphasize:

- bravery,
    
- self-sacrifice,
    
- the necessity of struggle,
    
- and the purity found in defending the weak.
    

The book’s prophecy speaks of a great convergence of “the real and unreal,” requiring extraordinary courage to restore balance.

---

### **5. The Book of Eldath**

_Authored by Prophet **Kelvath Orun**_

A counterpart to her sister’s work, the Book of Eldath teaches healing, compassion, and mercy. Kelvath’s journey focuses on service, restoration, and the quiet strength found in aiding others.

The stories within recount Eldath’s enduring patience and her sacrifices, including her iconic missing arm—a symbol mirrored in Kelvath’s own injury during her final pilgrimage trial.

Its prophecies envision a future where compassion will be tested on a global scale.

---

### **6. The Book of Oghma**

_Authored by Prophet **Seravus Morn**_

The most practical and philosophical of the Seven Books, it details innovation, invention, and the pursuit of understanding. Seravus recounts his failures, insights, and the moment of inspiration that led to the creation of the **wheel**.

The book features:

- treatises on knowledge,
    
- philosophical dialogues,
    
- early mechanical designs,
    
- and lessons on humility.
    

Uniquely, the **Book of Oghma contains no prophecy**—for Oghma rejects foresight as a distraction from human ingenuity and rational progress.

---

### **7. The Book of Tetford**

_Authored by Prophet **Eldra Vanton**_

The final book deals with the mysteries of **time**, its passage, its measurement, and its divine significance. Eldra describes her solitary pilgrimage and the profound visions imparted by Tetford.

Her writings present:

- the metaphysical structure of time,
    
- the first rudimentary calendars,
    
- and the concept of quantified eras.
    

Its prophecy is enigmatic and widely debated, describing the “untangling of time” and a cycle ending when “the count returns to its beginning.”
### **Sanctification of the Seven Books**

Upon completing their individual writings, the seven prophets reconvened and **unified their works into a single sacred canon**. Through ritual, counsel, and divine revelation, the texts were bound together and **sanctified as one holy scripture**, formally titled **_The Hexadem_**.

This unification symbolized the harmony of the six gods, the unity of the prophets’ journeys, and the foundation of the new faith. From that moment onward, the Seven Books were no longer viewed as separate testimonies, but as **one immortal volume**, the ultimate religious authority for millions across Omain.
## **Teachings and Taboos **

### **Teachings**

The Hexadem teaches a series of spiritual, ethical, and metaphysical principles derived from the **Seven Holy Books**, blending wisdom from all six gods and the journeys of their prophets. Though each deity embodies different virtues, the Hexadem emphasizes _balance_, insisting that no single divine value can stand alone without destabilizing the world.

#### **1. The Balance of the Six**

Followers are taught that the world remains stable only when the six divine forces—Reality, Space, Mind, Fate, Elements, and Time—are in harmony. Extreme devotion to one domain at the expense of the others is discouraged.

#### **2. Strength Through Understanding**

From Oghma’s teachings comes the belief that intellect, curiosity, and innovation elevate both mortals and civilizations. Knowledge is considered a sacred form of worship.

#### **3. Courage in Truth**

Tiamat’s guidance emphasizes the importance of bravery, accountability, and facing adversity rather than hiding from it. Courage is seen as a moral necessity.

#### **4. Compassion as Divine Legacy**

Eldath teaches empathy, kindness, and the preservation of life. Healing others is considered one of the purest acts of faith.

#### **5. Respect for the Natural Order**

Auriel’s followers uphold the sanctity of nature, elemental balance, and the physical world. Disrupting natural cycles is considered spiritually dangerous.

#### **6. Acceptance of Mortality**

Shar’s lessons instruct believers to acknowledge fear, death, and fragility without being consumed by them. Mortality is seen as a divine boundary meant to be respected.

#### **7. Awareness of Time**

Tetford’s influence teaches followers to honor the past, acknowledge the present, and prepare for the future. Wastefulness—of time, resources, or potential—is considered a mild spiritual failing.

#### **8. Pilgrimage as Personal Renewal**

Hexademic doctrine encourages at least one pilgrimage to a hexic temple in a follower’s lifetime. These journeys are meant for reflection, not penance.

#### **9. Unity Over Chaos**

The Hexadem teaches that discord—political, familial, or personal—weakens the world. Cooperation and societal order reflect divine intent.

---

### **Taboos**

Despite being a diverse and complex faith, the Hexadem enforces several universal prohibitions. Violating these is considered spiritually corruptive, and in the Erulian Empire, often illegal.

#### **1. Necromancy Without Sanction**

Because of Teleron Vesh’s near-catastrophic misuse of death magic, necromancy is heavily regulated. Only the highest clerics may practice controlled forms of it, and only for sacred purposes. Unauthorized use is one of the gravest taboos.

#### **2. Manipulation of Time**

Tetford forbids mortal interference with the flow of time. Any attempt to distort, foresee, or reverse time is viewed as blasphemous and dangerous.

#### **3. Elemental Defilement**

Polluting sacred natural sites, weaponizing storms, or abusing elemental energies for personal gain violates Auriel’s teachings. Entire regions have been spiritually “scarred” in past ages due to such actions.

#### **4. Wanton Cruelty**

Though the Hexadem accepts the necessity of conflict and fear, cruelty for its own sake—especially torture, mutilation, or needless suffering—is forbidden. Followers point to Shar’s teachings that fear must _teach_, not destroy without purpose.

#### **5. Destruction of Knowledge**

Burning books, suppressing learning, or hoarding information is seen as an affront to Oghma. Even heretical texts are preserved for study.

#### **6. Disruption of Sacred Death**

Desecrating graves, interfering in funerary rites, or mocking the dead is a severe taboo tied to Eldath’s teachings. Death is considered a sacred transition.

#### **7. Forsaking Pilgrimage**

Repeated and deliberate refusal to undertake a pilgrimage—especially by clergy or the nobility—is seen as a rejection of divine guidance.

#### **8. Denial of Balance**

Excessive devotion to a single deity to the exclusion of the others is considered spiritually dangerous. Fanaticism disrupts the divine equilibrium and is one of the few doctrinal errors the clergy actively intervenes against.

## **Structure of the Hexadem**

The Hexadem maintains a highly organized religious hierarchy divided into two principal branches: **the High Clergy** and **the Low Clergy**. This structure ensures theological consistency, administrative efficiency, and spiritual guidance throughout every region where the Hexadem is practiced.

---

### **The High Clergy**

The **High Clergy** forms the central governing body of the Hexadem. It consists of:

- **The Grand Hex** – supreme head of the faith
    
- **Five High Clerics** – senior authorities responsible for doctrine, discipline, ritual oversight, and temple governance
    

Together, these six figures determine all matters of faith, scripture interpretation, clerical appointments, and the supervision of major hexic temples across Omain.

#### **The Grand Hex**

**Grand Hex Selythar Morvath**  
The current Grand Hex and spiritual leader of the Hexadem, known for strict adherence to the Book of Tiamat and close collaboration with Empress Erolith I. His rulings shape the spiritual direction of the Erulian Empire and influence millions of followers worldwide.

#### **The Five High Clerics**

Each High Cleric oversees a major dimension of religious life, reflecting one of the divine domains (with one domain—Mortality—administered jointly).

The current High Clerics are:

- **High Cleric Velmira Shaeth** – _Mistress of the Elements_  
    Oversees teachings and rituals derived from the Book of Auriel; supervises elemental sanctuaries.
    
- **High Cleric Arveth Dornis** – _Warden of Fate and Mercy_  
    Manages doctrines relating to Eldath; leads the healing branches of the church.
    
- **High Cleric Tharoq Venhal** – _Keeper of Shadows_  
    Interprets Shar’s teachings; monitors forbidden magic and necromantic regulation.
    
- **High Cleric Jendral Voskar** – _Scribe of Mind and Innovation_  
    Oversees scholarly orders, scriptoria, and institutions inspired by Oghma.
    
- **High Cleric Maeriel Tovan** – _Chronist of Time_  
    Maintains religious calendars, temporal rites, and the interpretation of Tetford’s prophecies.
    

Together with the Grand Hex, these five clerics control all major decisions, revisions of doctrine, global pilgrimages, and appointments across the religious hierarchy.

---

### **The Low Clergy**

The **Low Clergy** encompasses the vast network of priests, temple guardians, acolytes, monks, and spiritual servants who maintain local religious life. While they do not hold the authority to interpret doctrine, they are essential to daily worship, education, and the care of sacred spaces.

#### **Responsibilities of the Low Clergy**

- Conducting daily rites and prayers
    
- Performing baptisms and marriages
    
- Guiding pilgrims
    
- Maintaining local temples and sanctuaries
    
- Educating children and uninitiated followers
    
- Assisting with community needs during crisis
    
- Enforcing basic taboos and spiritual etiquette
    

They serve in:

- **Town churches**
    
- **Village sanctuaries**
    
- **Urban temples**
    
- **Remote pilgrimage sites**
    
- **Hexic shrines** built on contested or sacred land
    

Although they lack decision-making power, the Low Clergy are considered the **heart of the Hexadem**, providing the connection between the religion’s towering theology and the lives of ordinary people.

## **Symbols & Rituals**

The Hexadem is a deeply ritualistic faith structured around symbolic representation, spiritual journeys, and rites of alignment with the Six Gods. While the religion emphasizes balance and doctrine through its Holy Books, its rituals maintain the personal and communal connection between worshippers and the divine.

---

### **Religious Symbols**

Each god of the Hexadem is represented by a physical artifact or natural object, used in rites, iconography, pilgrimages, and the sacred baptismal ceremony. These symbols are believed to hold echoes of the gods’ domains and serve as conduits of devotion.

|**Deity**|**Symbol**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|---|
|**Tiamat**|_Dragon Tooth_|Strength, reality, courage, righteous conflict|
|**Shar**|_Black Feather_|Fear, survival, shadow, the unknown|
|**Oghma**|**Silver Quill Cog**|Knowledge, invention, the union of thought and craft|
|**Auriel**|_Quartz Crystal_|Elements, nature, purity, balance|
|**Tetford**|_Hourglass_|Time, order, continuity of eras|
|**Eldath**|_String of Wheat_|Mercy, healing, nourishment, life|

The six symbols are placed at the six points of the Hexademic star and are used in almost every major ritual.

---

### **Rituals**

#### **1. Yearly Pilgrimages**

Every devout follower of the Hexadem is expected to undertake **annual pilgrimages** to at least one of the Seven Hexic Temples. While visiting all seven is considered a mark of deep devotion, even a single yearly journey fulfills one’s spiritual duty.

Pilgrimages are not performed as penance but as **renewal**, reflection, and reaffirmation of one’s chosen divine path.

---

### **2. Confessions**

Confession is a common ritual practiced across all branches of the Hexadem. A follower speaks privately with a priest or cleric to:

- seek guidance,
    
- release burdens,
    
- restore moral balance,
    
- or acknowledge spiritual missteps.
    

Confessions are not punitive; they are considered a form of alignment—re-centering oneself within the balance of the Six.

---

### **3. Daily Prayers**

Daily prayers vary by region, but most believers perform **two or three prayers per day**, typically aligned with:

- dawn (Auriel or Eldath),
    
- midday (Oghma or Tiamat),
    
- dusk (Shar or Tetford).
    

Each prayer is brief, guided more by personal intention than formal recitation.

---

### **Hexademic Baptism**

#### _The Rite of Alignment_

The most important ritual in the Hexadem is the **Hexademic Baptism**, a ceremony that binds a person to one of the Six Gods through the act of unconscious choice.

#### **Eligibility**

- Minimum age: **6 years old**
    
- No maximum age: anyone may undergo the rite at any time
    
- Exception: premature death before pilgrimage is not considered dishonorable
    

#### **The Ceremony**

1. The candidate travels to the **Grand Cathedral of Erule**, located in the imperial capital.
    
2. They are brought into the **Circular Chamber of Choosing**, a room marked by the **Hexademic star** (six-pointed star) on the floor.
    
3. A priest blindfolds the candidate to remove bias and sight.
    
4. At each point of the star sits one of the **Six Holy Artifacts**:
    
    - Dragon Tooth
        
    - Feather
        
    - Silver Quill Cog
        
    - Quartz Crystal
        
    - Hourglass
        
    - String of Wheat
        
5. The priest instructs the candidate to let their **heart lead them**, as the gods guide instinct and movement.
    
6. After a period of stillness, the candidate **involuntarily reaches out** and touches one artifact.
    
7. The artifact selected determines:
    
    - Their **patron deity**,
        
    - The **Holy Book** they are expected to follow,
        
    - Their **core virtues**
        
    - Their **spiritual role** within the faith
        
8. The candidate’s final obligation is to **undertake a pilgrimage** to their deity’s temple and offer a personal prayer.
    

Failure to complete this pilgrimage during one’s lifetime is seen as **deeply dishonorable**, with the exception of premature or unavoidable death.

## **Tensions**

Despite being the most influential religion in Omain, the Hexadem faces ongoing tensions that stem from internal disagreements, hostile rival faiths, and the political weight it carries in the Erulian Empire and beyond. These tensions shape the religion’s global perception and continually challenge its unity.

---

### **Internal Schisms**

Over its fifteen centuries of history, the Hexadem has endured numerous internal fractures—each small on its own, but collectively shaping its doctrine and identity.

#### **1. The Balance Schism**

A theological divide between followers who believe all six gods should be venerated equally and those who prioritize their patron deity above all others.  
The High Clergy condemns extreme devotion to a single god, but small sects devoted entirely to Shar, Tiamat, or Tetford persist in secrecy.

#### **2. The Veshanic Controversy**

Named after Teleron Vesh, this schism formed around debates over the extent to which **necromancy** should be allowed.  
Moderate clerics argue that it must remain strictly controlled; radicals believe Shar intended mortals to push further into death magic.  
Outlawed in most nations, Veshanists operate mostly underground.

#### **3. The Order of the Hexic Dawn**

A reformist movement seeking to minimize the political authority of the High Clergy and emphasize personal interpretation of the Seven Books.  
Though not heretical, it is seen as destabilizing by the Grand Hex and is quietly monitored.

#### **4. The Caladic Claim**

A fringe group maintains that the Aquabrand line is spiritually invalid after Talios II broke Hexademic law. Though tiny, this belief is considered treasonous within the empire.

---

### **Rival Faiths**

The Hexadem’s dominance has provoked several rival religions, but none are as pointed—or as controversial—as the one born in Uxbrid.

#### **Hexalemis — The Mocking Faith of Uxbrid**

The **Hexalemis** religion was created in the kingdom of **Uxbrid** as a _deliberate parody and criticism_ of the Hexadem. While superficially identical in structure—six gods, seven texts, pilgrimages, and symbols—it exaggerates and twists Hexademic doctrine into a rigidly oppressive system.

Key features include:

- A **mandatory belief system**, rather than one based on personal alignment
    
- Forced “alignment trials” instead of voluntary baptism
    
- A reinterpretation of the gods as punitive rather than guiding
    
- State-run temples used for political surveillance
    
- Severe punishments for doctrinal “impurity”
    

Although Hexalemis began as satirical protest against Erulian influence, it has grown into a genuine authoritarian religion within certain Uxbrid circles, alarming both their government and the Hexadem.

Other rival faiths include small tribal religions in Permatesh and animist traditions in Garenia, though none rival Hexalemis in ideological hostility.

---

### **Political Entanglements**

Because the Hexadem is inseparable from the Erulian Empire’s identity, its political involvements are often controversial.

#### **1. Influence Over the Erulian Throne**

The High Clergy’s guidance—or interference—has shaped imperial decisions for centuries. Monarchs who defy the clergy, such as Talios II, often trigger internal crises. Monarchs who obey too strongly are accused of being puppet rulers.

#### **2. Foreign Suspicion**

Neighboring nations mistrust the Hexadem’s close relationship with Erulian expansion. Some fear the faith is used to justify imperial dominance, especially regarding forced baptisms during the early empire.

#### **3. The Ka–Erule Rift**

The Kingdom of Ka, historically conquered by the empire, sees the Hexadem as a tool of colonization. Ka’s largely atheist population often protests its influence, especially after the assassination of Erolith’s father by King Marek.

#### **4. The Question of Kelar**

Dragons in Kelar acknowledge the Hexadem but do not follow it. Their Draconic Truth religion sometimes conflicts spiritually with Hexademic doctrine, though both sides avoid confrontation.

#### **5. Hexic Temples as Political Landmarks**

Several temples sit on contested borders. Control of pilgrimage routes often creates diplomatic disputes, particularly between Erule, Ka, and Permatesh.

---

### **Summary of Tensions**

The Hexadem, vast and influential, stands at the crossroads of faith, politics, and cultural identity. Its internal disagreements, external rivals, and deep political entanglements ensure that it remains both a stabilizing force and a source of ongoing controversy across Omain.

## **Deities**
### **Overview**

The Hexadem is built around the worship of **six divine beings**, each embodying a fundamental pillar of existence. These gods—Tiamat, Shar, Oghma, Auriel, Tetford, and Eldath—were created by the grieving deity **Drorialis** after the death of Orialis during the Lower Era of Population. Their purpose was to restore Omain, repopulate the world, and guide mortals through the metaphysical balance of life.

Each deity governs a specific domain, shaping both the spiritual world and mortal nature. Followers of the Hexadem do not worship all gods equally; instead, they are spiritually **aligned** to one deity through Hexademic Baptism, while respecting the equilibrium maintained by all six.

The gods differ in temperament, values, and influence, drawing distinct kinds of followers from all corners of Omain. Together, they form the theological foundation that has guided life for over fifteen centuries.
