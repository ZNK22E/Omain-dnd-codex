## Summary
The session began with **King Uhtred of Kelar** receiving a co-signed letter from **King Broxxar of Chilborkia** and **Empress Erolith of Erule**, warning of **mysterious figures appearing and vanishing across Omain**. Erolith formally summoned the world’s leaders to an emergency summit in Erule. While traveling, Uhtred’s convoy was **ambushed by crossbowmen and a strange man wearing a fox mask**, who clearly sought Uhtred’s pendant. Before the attackers could succeed, two travelers — **Markez and Ichten** — intervened, raining arrows on the bandits. As the fox-masked man was struck down, he **collapsed and vanished into thin air**. Markez and Ichten escorted Uhtred safely to Erule.

At the **Rose Palace**, the group was permitted to stay for the summit and attended a grand banquet. There, **Markez privately requested Empress Erolith to recognize his people as an independent nation**, which she refused. The following morning, **Caelum awoke in the back of a carriage** and was brought before Uhtred, who confirmed he was with Markez’s party. During the summit itself, Markez and Ichten snuck inside, but after an incident where Ichten spilled water on **Queen Elizabeth of Thaxted**, he was seized by guards and later returned… with a maid outfit.

During the summit, the **King of Permatesh** revealed that bandits had been attacking his lands, attempting to steal the **Stones of Jiwei**. Markez offered aid, which was accepted. Later, in private, **Empress Erolith promised Markez sovereignty** if he could deliver the three Stones to Erule. Before the summit concluded, the palace was infiltrated by more attackers. When defeated, the bandits were revealed to have **holes in their foreheads — and vanished upon death**, leaving no bodies behind. The threat was no longer distant. It was already inside the heart of the empire.
