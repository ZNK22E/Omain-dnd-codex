Thalorien Ji’waeth is the reigning King of the Elven Tribes of Permatesh, ruler of the vast, ancient forests that stretch across the heart of the continent. Unlike kings crowned by blood alone, Thalorien was chosen by **Jiwei, the Demon of Life**, a primordial being worshipped and feared by the forest-elves as the embodiment of growth, decay, rebirth, and survival.

His ascension did not come through conquest, but through trial. Thalorien was selected after defending the inner groves from a coalition of fire-bearing invaders, showing both **deep mercy toward the innocent** and **absolute ruthlessness toward those who sought to burn the forest realms**. Jiwei is said to have manifested within the Emerald Roots themselves and marked Thalorien as her chosen sovereign.

Since then, Thalorien has ruled not as a distant monarch, but as a living extension of the forest. His reign is regarded across Omain as one of the most stable, enlightened, and quietly powerful in existence.

He is father to **four children**—two daughters and two sons—each raised within different sacred groves so that none may forget the many voices of Permatesh.
## **Appearance**

Thalorien bears the unmistakable presence of an ancient forest made flesh.

He is tall and powerfully built for an elf, with a physique shaped more by survival than ceremony. His skin carries the warm, earthen tones of bark and leaf-shadow, etched faintly with natural markings and ritual scars earned during Jiwei’s trials. His ears are long and sharply tapered, adorned with living jewelry of wood, seed, and polished stone.

His hair is worn long, often braided and threaded with beads, feathers, and druidic talismans. Around his neck and chest hang layered cords of bone, crystal, and seed-gems, each representing a pact, a victory, or a life saved. His crown is not forged, but grown—an intricate circlet of twisted living wood set with luminous green stones said to be fragments of Jiwei’s essence.

Though he possesses ceremonial regalia, Thalorien most often wears **robes of layered bark-cloth, woven leaves, fur mantles, and vine-wrapped armor**, allowing him to move freely through the forest. His presence carries the scent of rain-soaked soil and blooming flowers, and many claim plants subtly lean toward him when he passes.
## **Personality**
Thalorien is widely regarded as **one of the wisest monarchs in the known world**.

He is gentle in speech, slow to anger, and deeply attentive. He listens far more than he commands, often remaining silent for long moments before answering. His kindness is sincere, especially toward his people, children, and the creatures of Permatesh. He is known to walk among the tribes without escort, sharing meals, settling disputes, and teaching young druids himself.

Yet this gentleness ends utterly where the forest is threatened.

Against loggers, fire-mages, blight cults, and invaders, Thalorien becomes cold, precise, and merciless. He does not torture, boast, or negotiate endlessly. He removes threats as one would remove rot from a root—cleanly and without regret.

Guided by Jiwei, he often speaks in layered meanings, balancing life and death, mercy and extinction. He is not ruled by emotion, but neither is he detached. His children describe him as warm and patient, yet impossibly demanding, teaching them that love without responsibility is decay.
## **Influence & Resources**

Permatesh is not a unified kingdom in the mortal sense—it is a **network of living domains**, sacred groves, moving settlements, and ancestral forest-cities. Thalorien’s power does not come from bureaucracy, but from **spiritual legitimacy and absolute loyalty**.

His influence includes:

- Command of the **Forest Tribes of Permatesh**, each led by Grove-Speakers who answer directly to him.
    
- The blessing of **Jiwei**, granting prophetic insight, accelerated healing, communion with ancient life, and dominion over living terrain.
    
- Control of some of the most valuable natural resources in Omain: life-crystals, ancient woods, alchemical flora, living metals, and druidic reagents.
    
- The **Greenwardens**, elite forest-knights and beastbound warriors capable of waging total war without leaving roads or ruins.
    
- Libraries of living memory—trees that record history, prophecy, and bloodlines within their rings.
    

Foreign empires often underestimate Permatesh due to its lack of cities and armies in the traditional sense. Those who have marched into its borders rarely return.
## **Goals**
Thalorien’s goals extend beyond politics and into the fate of the world itself:

- **Preserve the Living Balance** — ensuring that expansion, industry, and empire never eclipse the primal systems that sustain Omain.
    
- **Eradicate Fire Cults and Blight Orders** — those who seek to reshape nature through destruction rather than harmony.
    
- **Prepare His Heirs** — training his four children not merely as rulers, but as stewards, each aligned to different aspects of life.
    
- **Interpret Jiwei’s Warnings** — for the Demon of Life has begun showing him visions of forests burning beneath unfamiliar skies.
    
- **Influence the Powers of Omain Quietly** — guiding emperors and queens away from choices that would destabilize the world’s living foundations.
    

Thalorien does not seek conquest. He seeks endurance.
