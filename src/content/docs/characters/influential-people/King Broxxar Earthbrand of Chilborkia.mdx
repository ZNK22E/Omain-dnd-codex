**King Broxxar Earthbrand** is the reigning monarch of **Chilborkia** and bearer of the ancient title of **Earthbrand**, a name bound not only to royal blood but to the elemental soul of stone itself. He ascended to the throne not through war or intrigue, but through succession of peace—after his father, **King Durnhal Earthbrand**, voluntarily abdicated and retreated into a life of craft, study, and mountain solitude.

From the moment of his coronation, Broxxar proved to be unlike most kings.

He is not a ruler of halls and thrones, but of **streets, forges, and mines**. Broxxar rarely resides in his palace for long. Instead, he walks the avenues of the capital unguarded, drinks in the low halls of stonecutters, eats beside tunnel crews, and listens personally to merchants, engineers, and laborers. It is not uncommon for travelers to mistake him for a master mason or veteran foreman before realizing the crown-braid worked into his beard.

Because of this, the people of Chilborkia do not merely respect their king.

They **love** him.

Under Broxxar’s rule, Chilborkia has known an unprecedented era of internal peace. For **twenty-six consecutive years**, the kingdom has seen **no revolts, no mass unrest, no civil bloodshed, and no separatist movements**—a record unmatched anywhere else in Omain’s modern history. Disputes are settled by councils, labor conflicts by reform, and regional grievances by the king’s direct involvement.

Chilborkia is often noted as the **second least populous nation in the world**, yet consistently recorded as having the **highest average quality of life and public contentment**. Wages are fair, labor protections are strong, clan representation is balanced, and no dwarf goes unfed beneath Broxxar’s crown.

Scholars, imperial observers, and foreign envoys alike agree on a single conclusion:

Chilborkia is happy because Broxxar is present.

Not as a distant authority—but as one of them.

Where other monarchs rule from marble and gold, Broxxar rules from **stone dust and shared breath**, and in doing so has forged the most socially stable kingdom Omain has ever known.
## **Appearance**

(Portrait of King Broxxar on his throne, art by: Thromrik Gemhand, 1493 A.H)

King Broxxar Earthbrand is a stout and powerfully built dwarf, even by the standards of Chilborkia. His frame is broad and dense, his posture naturally grounded, giving the impression of a man rooted as firmly as the mountains he rules. Age has only thickened him rather than weakened him—his shoulders remain wide, his arms corded with old strength, and his hands permanently marked by a life spent among stone, metal, and people rather than silks and distant thrones.

His skin carries the warm, weathered tone common to the deep-folk, etched faintly with old scars from labor and earlier years of battle. His eyes are dark and steady, often lit with quiet humor, and rarely with suspicion. When he speaks, his expression is open, his gaze direct, lacking the guarded distance of most monarchs.

Broxxar’s hair and beard are a deep copper-red, worn long and braided in traditional Chilborkian fashion. The beard is thick and heavy, often adorned with simple stone clasps or clan-rings rather than jewels, each braid carrying cultural meaning rather than vanity.

In ceremony, Broxxar wears the full regalia of kingship: a heavy gem-set crown, ancestral ceremonial armor, and the Earthbrand insignia of his house. These garments are masterworks of dwarven craft, worn only during coronations, foreign audiences, religious rites, and moments of state gravity.

In daily life, however, he is rarely seen in such attire. Broxxar favors **casual yet finely made clothing**—high-quality wool tunics, leather-reinforced coats, fur-lined cloaks, and miner-king boots suited more for streets and halls than thrones. His garments are practical, comfortable, and expertly crafted, but never ostentatious. It is not uncommon to find him dressed like a well-off craftsman rather than a monarch, walking among his people with little visual distinction beyond the respect he commands.

He looks less like a crowned symbol, and more like what he is:

a dwarf of Chilborkia first—  
and a king only second.

## **Personality**
King Broxxar Earthbrand is a ruler of uncommon warmth among kings and uncommon steadiness among dwarves. Where many monarchs of Chilborkia’s past ruled from carved thrones and sealed halls, Broxxar rules from the streets, the forges, and the deep roads of his realm. He is approachable to a fault—known to share meals with miners, drink with stonecutters, and sit unannounced in guild circles to hear grievances firsthand. This has earned him not only loyalty, but genuine affection.

Despite his open manner, Broxxar is no fool. He possesses a quiet, granite-like intellect: slow to anger, slower to judge, but immovable once his mind is set. He prefers mediation over decree, compromise over command, and tradition over vanity. When conflict arises, he listens long before he speaks—and when he finally does, his words tend to settle matters rather than inflame them.

Broxxar carries a deep reverence for dwarven culture and memory. He is intensely proud of Chilborkia’s crafts, songs, and ancestral rites, and treats kingship not as dominion, but as stewardship. He sees himself as a keeper of balance between stone and soul, prosperity and contentment, progress and heritage.

Privately, he is reflective and almost melancholic at times, often retreating into the deeper halls or old tunnels simply to walk and think. He fears becoming distant from the lives he rules, and actively resists the isolation of royalty. This fear is one of the reasons he avoids the palace—he believes a king who lives only among crowns will forget the weight of calloused hands.

Though gentle in peace, Broxxar is unyielding when Chilborkia is threatened. His mercy does not extend to those who endanger his people, exploit the deep places, or dishonor dwarven law. In such moments, the warmth fades, and the Earthbrand emerges—calm, relentless, and impossible to sway.

To his people, Broxxar is not merely a king. He is proof that authority can walk beside joy, and that a crown need not rise above the crowd to lead it.
## **Influence & Resources**

King Broxxar Earthbrand presides over one of the most materially rich yet socially grounded realms in all of Omain. Chilborkia, carved into vast mountain chains and deep-rooted stone valleys, is renowned not for its population or military reach, but for the sheer quality of what it produces and the stability with which it produces it.

The kingdom’s greatest resource lies beneath its feet. Chilborkian lands contain some of the purest known veins of iron, deepsteel, ember-copper, and soul-stone in the world, alongside rare crystalline formations used by both arcanists and Hexadem clergy. These mines are tightly regulated under royal law—one of Broxxar’s most praised reforms—ensuring that extraction never outpaces sustainability. Entire ranges are rotated between active, dormant, and sacred status, preserving both the mountains and the communities that depend on them.

Chilborkian forges are unmatched. The weapons, tools, armor, and structural components crafted in the capital and the great forge-cities are considered the finest in Omain. Erulian legions, western navies, and even the advanced engineers of Grantia rely on Chilborkian metalwork. While Chilborkia fields a comparatively small standing army, its economic leverage through smithing, construction materials, and mechanical craft grants it immense indirect power.

Broxxar’s influence is felt most strongly through trade and diplomacy. Chilborkian trade routes thread through much of Droskarin and into Virelya, making the kingdom a logistical keystone between continents. Rather than imposing tariffs aggressively, Broxxar has cultivated long-term forge accords—binding trade partnerships that exchange stability and quality guarantees for political goodwill. Many realms owe the integrity of their infrastructure to Chilborkian hands.

Culturally, Chilborkia exerts a quieter but profound influence. Its model of communal labor, regulated industry, and king-to-citizen closeness has inspired reformist movements in several smaller states. Dwarven guilds abroad often swear secondary oaths to Chilborkian codes, spreading its standards even beyond its borders.

Religiously, Chilborkia holds special significance to followers of Auriel and the Hexadem due to the lineage of the Earthbrand. Pilgrims regularly travel to the mountain shrines tied to the ancient bearer of the Soul of Earth. This grants Broxxar spiritual authority beyond his political station, particularly among elemental sects and Aurielite orders.

Internally, Broxxar’s greatest resource is not stone or metal, but trust. The absence of revolts, strikes, or major unrest for over two decades has created an environment of rare unity. Guilds cooperate, clans negotiate, and regional holds defer to the crown without coercion. This social cohesion allows Chilborkia to mobilize quickly, rebuild rapidly, and weather crises that would fracture other realms.
## **Goals**
King Broxxar Earthbrand does not dream of conquest, legacy carved in blood, or monuments raised in his own image. His ambitions are quieter, but far deeper.

Above all else, Broxxar seeks to **preserve Chilborkia’s happiness without sacrificing its future**. He understands that prosperity is fragile, and that the joy his people live in today rests on choices made decades prior. His foremost goal is to ensure that Chilborkia never becomes a kingdom that must trade its people’s well-being for power, speed, or foreign pressure. Every reform, mining charter, and trade accord is weighed against one question: _Will this still be good for them when I am gone?_

A central objective of his reign is the **complete codification of sustainable deep-law**—a binding system of geological, cultural, and economic protections meant to outlast any single monarch. Broxxar intends these laws to become so deeply embedded in Chilborkian identity that even a tyrant could not uproot them. He wishes to leave behind not a strong throne, but an unbreakable way of life.

Broxxar is also driven by a personal mission to **dissolve the distance between crown and citizen permanently**. He has begun laying groundwork for local councils, rotating guild assemblies, and regional charters that grant communities more authority over their own labor and welfare. His long-term hope is to shape a Chilborkia that would remain just even without a good king.

On the world stage, Broxxar’s goal is to **keep Chilborkia indispensable, but never dominant**. He wants the realm to be too valuable to be conquered, too respected to be coerced, and too interwoven to be isolated. Through forge treaties, neutral trade routes, and inter-kingdom engineering projects, he seeks to bind Omain together in quiet dependence on cooperation rather than fear.

Privately, Broxxar harbors a deeper, almost spiritual aim: to **honor the Earthbrand lineage not through power, but through guardianship**. He believes the soul of earth was never meant to raise kings above others, but to root them among their people. He fears the day when Chilborkia might be forced into war or domination, and works tirelessly to shape a world where stone is built upon, not thrown.

His ultimate hope is simple, and perhaps the most difficult of all:

That Chilborkia will never need another ruler like him.

## **The Clod**

Broxxar Earthbrand is one of only two living vessels of the **Clod**, the ancient elemental soul of earth forged by Auriel at the dawn of Omain and bound to mortal blood through the first Earthbrand. The second is his son, **Dorrim Earthbrand**, still young by dwarven measure, but already carrying the faint, resonant presence of the Clod within him.

The Clod does not exist within them as a dormant force, but as a **shared soul**—a slow, breathing consciousness that settles between father and son like the roots of a mountain split across two peaks. Through ancient Earthbrand rites, the soul is not transferred upon death, but **gradually divided**, allowing wisdom, memory, and elemental stability to pass while the previous bearer yet lives. Because of this, Broxxar has spent many years preparing Dorrim not to wield the Clod, but to **understand her**.

Broxxar maintains his bond through **daily meditation**, practiced deep within natural caverns, unworked stone sanctums, and silent halls where no hammer has ever struck. These meditations are not acts of control. They are acts of **listening**. The Clod is fed not by violence or conquest, but by patience, breath, and stillness—by the dwarf’s willingness to feel the slow turning of the world beneath his feet.

When Broxxar speaks of the Clod, he never refers to her as a power. He speaks of her as **“She Who Remains.”**

He has **never used the Clod for war**.

On the rare occasions he assumes her aspect, it is only for preservation: to **brace collapsing mines**, to **draw the living from landslides**, to **seal shattered vaults**, to **calm unstable fault-lines**, or to **carry entire stone roofs upon his back while survivors flee beneath him**. Among the people of Chilborkia, it is said that when Broxxar walks as the Clod, the mountains do not tremble—**they sigh in relief.**

His relationship with the Clod is deeply personal. Their communion is most vivid during meditation, where conversation occurs not in words, but in **pressure, memory, and sensation**: the feeling of ancient roots, the warmth of magma far below, the weight of continents, the sorrow of broken caverns, the comfort of resting stone. The Clod is pleased with Broxxar, not for his strength, but for his restraint. She has known kings who sought to become mountains. Broxxar chose instead to **stand beside them.**

With Dorrim, the Clod is gentler still. Broxxar often meditates with his son seated across from him, both hands on the cavern floor, allowing the Clod to stretch between them. In these moments, father, son, and element are bound in silence, preparing for the day when Broxxar will step back entirely and the Clod will rest whole within the next Earthbrand.

Among the deep halls of Chilborkia, an old saying is whispered:

_“Steel defends a kingdom. Stone endures it. But only the Clod remembers why.”_
