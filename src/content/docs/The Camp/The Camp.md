# Camp

Camping allows the party to rest, recover, craft, and interact with their travelling NPC companions.  
Certain NPCs **travel with the party at all times** but are **only interactable while camp is established**.

Camping is a **core progression mechanic** tied to resources, exhaustion, and long-term upgrades.

---

## Camping Restrictions

The party **cannot camp** if:
- The area is **hostile**, **actively dangerous**, or **cramped**
- They are **mid-dungeon**, **in combat**, or **being pursued**
- There is insufficient space to set up camp infrastructure

Camping **is allowed**:
- In wilderness
- On roads or open terrain
- In cleared ruins or safe zones
- Near settlements (with DM discretion)

---

## Camp Requirements

To establish camp, the party must have:
- **Food**
- **Water**

If either is missing, the party may still camp, but **exhaustion rules apply** (see below).

---

## Rest Types

### Short Rest — 4 Hours
- Recovers **50% of all spent resources**
- If watch is required, characters on watch only gain **half** of this benefit

### Long Rest — 8 Hours
- Recovers **100% of all spent resources**
- Removes exhaustion as per system rules
- If watch is required, characters on watch only gain **half** benefits

---

## Time Pressure & Exhaustion

- Characters **cannot go more than 15 hours without camping**
- After 15 hours:
  - Every **additional 10 hours** without camping grants **1 level of exhaustion**

### Hunger
- After **2 days without food**:
  - Gain **1 exhaustion level per day**

### Thirst
- After **2 days without water**:
  - Gain **2 exhaustion levels per day**

---

## Wilderness Camping & Watch

If camping in the wilderness:

1. The DM rolls **1d6 – 2**
2. The result determines **how many watches** are required

### Watch Rules
- Watches **must rotate**
- A character who stands watch for the **entire rest**:
  - Gains **no rest benefits**
- Characters who stand **partial watch**:
  - Gain **half rest benefits**

Failure to set watch may result in:
- Ambush
- Stolen supplies
- Environmental hazards
- Narrative complications
## Hired Watch NPCs

The party may hire **up to 3 Watch NPCs** found throughout the world to assist with camp security.

### Watch NPC Rules

- Watch NPCs **do not participate in combat** unless explicitly stated by the DM
    
- They **automatically fulfill watch requirements**
    
- They **do not consume rest benefits**
    
- They **prevent exhaustion penalties** related to standing watch
    

Each hired NPC occupies **one watch slot**.

---

### Payment & Upkeep

- Watch NPCs require **weekly payment**
    
- Payment is made **at the start of each in-game week**
    
- If payment is missed:
    
    - The NPC leaves the party peacefully
        
    - Any unfinished watch coverage is lost immediately
        

The cost depends on:

- Region
    
- Skill level
    
- Current danger rating of the area
    

---

### Limits & Conditions

- Maximum of **3 Watch NPCs** may be hired at a time
    
- Watch NPCs:
    
    - Cannot replace required player watches if the DM rules extreme danger
        
    - May flee or refuse service in exceptionally hostile zones
        
- Some NPCs may require:
    
    - Personal quests
        
    - Reputation thresholds
        
    - Camp upgrades
---

## Camp Structure

Once established, camp consists of:

- **NPC Companions**
- **Workshops**
- **Shared Storage**
- **Fire & Shelter**

Players may interact with camp **freely and repeatedly** while camp is active.

---
## Food & Water Consumption

Every time the party establishes camp, **each creature present consumes supplies**.

### Consumption Rules

- **Each player character** consumes:
    
    - 1 ration of **food**
        
    - 1 ration of **water**
        
- **Each camp NPC** consumes:
    
    - 1 ration of **food**
        
    - 1 ration of **water**
        
- **Each hired Watch NPC** also consumes:
    
    - 1 ration of **food**
        
    - 1 ration of **water**
        

Consumption occurs **when camp is established**, not per rest type.

---

## Starvation & Dehydration (NPCs)

### Hired Watch NPCs

- If a hired Watch NPC:
    
    - Goes **2 days without food or water**
        
    - They **leave without warning**
        
    - Any paid time is forfeited
        

They do not gain exhaustion — they simply disappear.

---

### Camp NPCs (Companions & Specialists)

Camp NPCs follow exhaustion rules similar to players.

- After **2 days without food**:
    
    - Gain **1 exhaustion level per day**
        
- After **2 days without water**:
    
    - Gain **2 exhaustion levels per day**
        

### Exhaustion Consequences

- At **Exhaustion Level 3**:
    
    - The NPC **leaves the camp**
        
    - Friendship progress is frozen
        
    - They may return later at DM discretion
        

---

## Resource Pressure (Design Intent)

- Camps scale in cost as the party grows
    
- NPCs are a **logistical commitment**, not free bonuses
    
- Poor planning can fracture the party’s support network
    


--- 
## NPC Companions

NPCs that travel with the party are only interactable **inside camp**.

### Friendship Level

Each NPC has a **Friendship Level** that increases based on:
- Helping them with personal requests
- Providing materials they value
- Making choices aligned with their beliefs
- Defending or supporting them in story moments

Friendship levels unlock:
- New dialogue
- Workshop upgrades
- Passive bonuses
- Special crafting options
- Story events

---
## Camp Workshops

Workshops are permanent camp structures that enable crafting, services, and progression.  
Each workshop requires the appropriate **NPC role** to function and can be **upgraded** by delivering materials to the camp.

Workshops persist between camps unless destroyed by narrative events.

---

## Smithy

The Smithy is the backbone of the camp’s martial readiness.  
It is operated by a single travelling smith who maintains the party’s gear and forges new tools of war.

---

### Smithy Operator

**Name:** Kaelen Rook  
**Race:** Human  
**Age:** 24  
**Build:** Lean, wiry, and visibly muscular from years of manual labor  

Kaelen speaks little while working, preferring the sound of hammer on anvil to conversation. Despite his age, he is already a highly capable smith, shaped by hardship and constant travel. He joined the camp seeking purpose rather than coin, and his respect must be earned through action rather than words.

---

### Using the Smithy

Players may access the Smithy **only by interacting directly with Kaelen while camp is active**.

The Smithy allows players to:

- **Repair weapons and armor**
- **Reinforce weapons and armor** to improve durability

- **Stock up on projectiles** (arrows, bolts, thrown weapons, etc.)
- **Craft weapons and armor** using available materials

All crafting and repairs consume:
- Time
- Materials
- Occasionally coin or favors (DM discretion)

---

### Limitations

- The Smithy is **inactive** if Kaelen is absent, injured, or has left the camp
- Advanced crafting options may require:
  - Higher friendship level with Kaelen
  - Smithy upgrades
  - Rare materials

---

> **Note:**  
> *Refer to the Smithy page for information on upgrades.*

---

### Design Notes (DM Use)

- Kaelen’s friendship level may unlock:
  - Unique weapon traits
  - Faster crafting times
  - Experimental reinforcements
- His personal story can be tied to rare metals, lost forges, or rival smiths

## Alchemy Station

The Alchemy Station is a carefully controlled workspace dedicated to chemical synthesis, experimental brews, and volatile concoctions.  
It serves both practical survival needs and more questionable battlefield applications.

---

### Alchemy Operator

**Name:** Pibbin Thistleknot  
**Race:** Gnome  
**Age:** 30  
**Build:** Small-framed, sharp-eyed, perpetually stained with alchemical residue  

Pibbin is relentlessly curious and rarely still, often muttering calculations under his breath while adjusting burners or swirling vials. Though outwardly excitable, he is meticulous in his work and deeply respectful of preparation and precision. He joined the camp to pursue experimentation beyond the restrictions of formal guilds.

---

### Using the Alchemy Station

Players may access the Alchemy Station **only by interacting directly with Pibbin while camp is active**.

The Alchemy Station allows players to:

- **Refine raw reagents** into usable alchemical components

All alchemical work consumes:
- Ingredients and reagents
- Time
- Occasionally coin or rare catalysts (DM discretion)

---

### Risk & Experimentation

Some recipes may be marked as **Experimental**:
- Experimental brews may:
  - Produce unexpected side effects
  - Fail or explode

## Cooking Fire

The Cooking Fire is the heart of the camp’s daily survival.  
It provides nourishment, morale, and carefully prepared meals that can enhance the party’s abilities for a limited time.

---

### Cooking Fire Operator

**Name:** Sylvaen Lethariel  
**Race:** Elf  
**Age:** 184 (recently considered an adult by elven standards)  
**Build:** Slender, composed, with practiced and graceful movements  

Sylvaen approaches cooking with the same reverence others reserve for magic. To her, food is not merely sustenance but a ritual of balance between body, land, and time. She travels to understand how different peoples survive the world, believing that every culture leaves a story in its meals.

---

### Using the Cooking Fire

Players may access the Cooking Fire **only by interacting directly with Sylvaen while camp is active**.

The Cooking Fire allows players to:

- **Extract rations from hunted animals**
- **Preserve food** to prevent spoilage
- **Prepare meals** that grant temporary bonuses
- **Improve ration efficiency**, reducing food consumption
- **Create specialty dishes** tied to regions or cultures

Meals typically provide:
- Temporary boosts to skills or saving throws
- Minor combat or travel bonuses
- Increased recovery during rests

Effects and duration are determined by:
- Ingredients used
- Recipe quality
- Sylvaen’s friendship level

---

### Meal Effects

- Only **one meal buff** may be active per character at a time
- Stronger meals overwrite weaker effects
- Buff duration is defined by the recipe (DM discretion)

---

## Merchant Stall

The Merchant Stall is an unreliable but valuable source of supplies, curiosities, and coin exchange.  
Unlike other workshops, it is not always present when camp is established.

---

### Merchant Operator

**Name:** Valis Cindervale  
**Race:** Tiefling  
**Age:** 28  
**Profession:** Bard / Trader  

Valis is charming, sharp-tongued, and perpetually amused by the dangers of the road. He claims to follow “interesting people rather than profitable routes,” appearing and vanishing from the camp without warning. His wagon is filled with music, stories, and goods from places the party may never have heard of.

---

### Appearance Chance

Each time the party establishes camp:

- Roll **1d4**
  - **1-2** — Valis does **not** appear
  - **3-4** — Valis sets up his Merchant Stall

This roll is made **once per camp**.

If Valis does not appear:
- The Merchant Stall is unavailable for that camp
- The result cannot be rerolled until the next camp

---

### Limitations

- The Merchant Stall:
  - Does **not** allow crafting
  - Does **not** buy all items indiscriminately
- Rare or powerful items may:
  - Cost significantly more
  - Require favors or story hooks
  - Be available only once

---

## Builder’s Table

The Builder’s Table is the structural backbone of the camp.  
It governs construction, fortification, and long-term expansion, enabling the camp to evolve from a temporary shelter into a permanent settlement.

---

### Builder Operator

**Name:** Brokkir Stonevein  
**Race:** Dwarf  
**Age:** 56  
**Build:** Broad-shouldered, heavy-set, with scarred hands and a perpetually dusted beard  

Brokkir is pragmatic, methodical, and slow to trust. He believes that anything worth building must be able to endure weather, war, and time itself. He travels with the camp to prove that even impermanent people deserve structures that last.

---

### Using the Builder’s Table

Players may access the Builder’s Table **only by interacting directly with Brokkir while camp is active**.

The Builder’s Table allows players to:

- This unlocks:
  - Fixed structures
  - NPC population growth
  - Trade routes
  - Political and narrative consequences

Settlement status is:
- Location-bound
- Persistent
- A major world event

---

### Limitations

- The Builder’s Table is **inactive** if Brokkir is absent or leaves the camp
- Major constructions may require:
  - Rare materials
  - Multiple camps worth of time
  - High friendship level with Brokkir

---
